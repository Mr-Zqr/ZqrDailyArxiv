Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains\nchallenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has\nbenefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be\nnotoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has\nsucceeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still\nlargely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing\nMultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into\ntraditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase\nour framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on\nmultimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation\nvideo, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without\nany real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world\npouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of\ngenerative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the\nmultimodal sim-to-real gap.\n","authors":["Renhao Wang","Haoran Geng","Tingle Li","Feishi Wang","Gopala Anumanchipalli","Philipp Wu","Trevor Darrell","Boyi Li","Pieter Abbeel","Jitendra Malik","Alexei A.

While operations above the forest canopy are already highly\nautomated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on\nmanual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation\nSatellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the\ndrone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently,\nadvancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied\nobstacle-rich areas.

Specifically, the study focused on\ncamera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric\npost-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera.\nThe autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through\nmultiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation\ncapability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH)\nestimation.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

Existing methods prioritize locomotion\nrobustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and\nenergy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical\nlearning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force\ndisturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking\npolicy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical\nproprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through\nsupervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on\nproprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,\ninspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and\npolicy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in\nresponse to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the\ncompliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor\ndisturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking\na balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world\nexperiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms\nof robustness, energy efficiency, and safety.

In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based\nschemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration\nspace. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being\nprimarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient\npath-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing\ntime.

Information extracted from\nthe latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense\nintegration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We\ndesign a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and\ndesign a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer\nmemory is uniform and efficient.

Until recently, there appeared to\nbe no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this\nhas changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer\nmatching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it\ngenerate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the\nreference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare\nthe validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and\nGPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each\nevaluation approach.

Experiments\non benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data\nregimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to\nother species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and\nfunctional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where\nexperimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical\nfeature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,\nsuch as binding motifs and functional annotations.

Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM.

In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying\nnormalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We\nfocus on binary features and show that their class balances (proportions of\nones) directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect\ndepends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We\ndemonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with\ntheir variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of\nridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance of the\ncoefficient estimates. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty\nweights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we\nalso tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and\nprovide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.\n","authors":["Johan Larsson","Jonas Wallin"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03821v3.pdf","comment":"39 pages, 18 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02506v1","updated":"2025-07-03T10:13:42Z","published":"2025-07-03T10:13:42Z","title":"IndianBailJudgments-1200: A Multi-Attribute Dataset for Legal NLP on\n  Indian Bail Orders","summary":"  Legal NLP remains underdeveloped in regions like India due to the scarcity of\nstructured datasets.

This study proposes a novel quantum\nPeter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any\nassumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional\nindependence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces\ncharacterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal\nrelations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We\nconducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures,\ndemonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly\nwith smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart.

We\npresent ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand\nmanipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention.\nInstead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated\ntraining scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger\ninput flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical\ninteractions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a\nthree-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning,\nIntention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy\nensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user\ninputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity\nreward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training\nconvergence.

Recent developments have achieved\nthis by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.\nHowever, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction\nparadigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible\nsemantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and\ngenerate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and\nunderstanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent\nnovel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from\nonly sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model\nthat can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics\n(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge\nintegration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),\ntrained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language\nembeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.\nFinally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language\ninformation onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language\nqueries.

Creating such detailed face avatars from\nvideos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and\nvirtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static\nfaces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny\nvalley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face\nthrough a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static\nfaces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,\ncomplex lighting effects, and fine details.

Our insights\nlead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate\nGaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases\nexpressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,\nsplatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires\ninverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix.

Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D\nsequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published\nanalytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,\nincluding six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,\nand three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were\nassessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from\nindependent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six\ndifferent DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity\ncoefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics\nand voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans\nfrom patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were\nwarped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of\nDIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error\nestimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling\nrealistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean\nlog Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to\npublished real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of\ndetailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose\nmapping accuracy.

Evaluating such\nrobustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic\ninsights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups\nfail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we\nintroduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key\nrequirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM\nrobustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily\ntranslate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that\nare inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail\nto capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models\n(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks\ninterpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines\nshould be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM.

We aim to investigate the impact of common bias\nmitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based\nCMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance\nreweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to\nmitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root\ncauses of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using\nmodels trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be\nmitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the\nunderrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority\nWhite subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for\nboth ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias\nmitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing\nthe models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation\nperformance and no statistically significant bias.\n","authors":["Tiarna Lee","Esther Puyol-Antón","Bram Ruijsink","Pier-Giorgio Masci","Louise Keehn","Phil Chowienczyk","Emily Haseler","Miaojing Shi","Andrew P.

This synergy has sparked a\ntechnological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial\nintelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining\nhuman-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous\nintelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource\nconsumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To\naddress these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary\nframework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a\nparticular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud\nframework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,\nand cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model\ninference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to\na series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling\neffective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource\nconstraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based\nintelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging\ncommunication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI\nmodels across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses\nthe capability of any single model.

Among them,\npedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the\nmost popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or\nappearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex\nscenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often\nprevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,\nnon-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial\nvisibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform\ntracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,\nthe existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods\nmainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and\nnon-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing\ndataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from\nadequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale\ndataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view\nand all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because\nthere are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33\nvideos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with\na complete bounding box and a unique object ID.

One of the\nmost predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which\nhas been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as\nAlzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL\nmodels in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,\nespecially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions.

Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data\nfrom one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in\nclinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary\nlengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient\nvariability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation\n(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain\nfragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this\nsetting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)\nframework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant\nrepresentations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific\nprompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming\nfragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation\nsince only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we\nfirst introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the\nprompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked\nconsistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model\nrepresentations.

Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel\nweakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key\ncomponents: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the\nboundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances\nfeature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity\ntransformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast\nvariations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by\nmasking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global\nanatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to\nrecover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper\nsemantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP\nmodule enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing\ndual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a\nboundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement.

This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,\nwhich are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps.

First, manually\nconstructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is\nlabor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small\nobjects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain\nadaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to\ncapture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when\nsegmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by\nfew-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM\nutilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific\nobjects.

We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that\njointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of\npre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both\nreconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as\na method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure\nfrom disjoint inputs.

These tasks are traditionally executed with a\nlinear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their\nlocation, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of\nwhich, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario\n(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).\nHowever, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,\nwhile making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to\nerrors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and\ncomputational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop\ntechniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives\nrise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a\nsmall computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,\nhearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this\neffect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where\nthe tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate\nfor local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to\ncorrect the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the\nlocalization's sensitivity towards interferences.

However, existing\nmethods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,\nprimarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly\nmodel the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily\nleads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,\nthey treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual\nobservation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct\nmultimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile\nmanipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion\nTransformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination\nfor end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base\ndirectly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body\nconditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion\nrepresentations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body\nactions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact\nof the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at\ndifferent stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware\nmultimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights\nbetween various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features\ntailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for\nexample, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial\nfor action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric\ninformation when precise spatial understanding is required.

This order is designed to\nfacilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help\npeople and models learn the discovery process of the proof.

Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual\nco-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented\nexecution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery.

Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to\nparallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference\nlatency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the\nnetwork edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To\nenable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose\n\\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding\nframework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding\nefficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important\ndraft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to\nprune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during\nverification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality\nspeculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline\nutilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world\ntestbed with other baselines.

One of the\nmost predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which\nhas been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as\nAlzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL\nmodels in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,\nespecially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the\nother hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can\nprovide important information for learning good representations that can be\ntransferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an\nanatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical\ninformation in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To\nvalidate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the\ndiagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum\ndisorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10\ndifferent clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data.

Due to their linguistic capacities, it\nis possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual\ncoding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most\nexisting research on this topic has focused on English-language responses\nrelating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its\nfindings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to\nestablished methods.

These methods directly optimize the\nmodel parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model\nperformance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.\nIn contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward\nfunctions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high\ninference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward\nor value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a\nmethod named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model\nwithout touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples\ncandidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,\nand (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding\npass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model\ngeneration via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply\nIRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement\nfine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.\n","authors":["Xinnan Zhang","Chenliang Li","Siliang Zeng","Jiaxiang Li","Zhongruo Wang","Kaixiang Lin","Songtao Lu","Alfredo Garcia","Mingyi Hong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17828v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02319v1","updated":"2025-07-03T05:11:41Z","published":"2025-07-03T05:11:41Z","title":"Iterated belief revision: from postulates to abilities","summary":"  The belief revision field is opulent in new proposals and indigent in\nanalyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as\nsyntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some\nproperties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain\nrevisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the\nrevision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no\nother change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect\nwhat they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all\npossible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from\nno previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where\neverything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally\nbelieved? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible\nrequires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions\nmay be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An\napplication where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them\ndogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in\nspecific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate.

An\nideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal\nbackground intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the\ncorresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a\nsemantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse\nappearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based\nmethods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly\ngenerators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when\nthe mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting\nwith multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all\nthree issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting\nbackbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the\nsynthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background\ncorruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can\ncause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian\nprompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that\nbroadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual\nappearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local\ntexture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms\nsemantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains\nplausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary\nartifacts.

This\noverlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift\npermanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid\nadaptation.\n  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift\nthat simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a\nbaseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained\nfrom scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution.

Traditional methods typically use unimodal\ndistributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value\ndistributions.

This paper\nproposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D\n(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges\nof estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy\nrepresentations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that\ncan converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy\nentropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can\naccurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by\ngenerating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion\nmodel.

To address\nthis, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving\npriors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple\nstages of increasing complexity.

Yet, how robotic design cues might\nelicit misleading perceptions in people with dementia, and how these\nperceptions arise, remains insufficiently understood. In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality. Thematic analysis of user responses reveals that people\nwith dementia often attribute biological, social, and mental capacities to\nrobots, dynamically shifting between awareness and illusion. These findings\nunderscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia\ncontexts. Existing definitions of robotic deception often rest on philosophical\nor behaviorist premises, but rarely engage with the cognitive mechanisms\ninvolved. We propose an empirically grounded definition: robotic deception\noccurs when Type 1 (automatic, heuristic) processing dominates over Type 2\n(deliberative, analytic) reasoning, leading to misinterpretation of a robot's\nartificial nature.

An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite.

This gap is critical, as user-aligned\nbehavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous\nvehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets\nannotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the\ndevelopment and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we\npresent the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations\ncapturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for\npersonalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from\nreal-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned\nvisual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario\nconstruction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference\nannotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.\nTo address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the\nVLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and\ndriver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a\nhuman-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building\non this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized\nE2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without\npreference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized\npreferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays\nthe foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to\nsystematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,\ncatalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.\n","authors":["Ruiyang Hao","Bowen Jing","Haibao Yu","Zaiqing Nie"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.23982v1.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 4 figures"}]}}
