                                        <span>  Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the
real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

extract the space in which optimal solutions may exist. Further sampling and

                                        <span>  As large models gain traction, vision-language-action (VLA) systems are
enabling robots to tackle increasingly complex tasks. However, limited by the
difficulty of data collection, progress has mainly focused on controlling
simple gripper end-effectors. There is little research on functional grasping
with large models for human-like dexterous hands. In this paper, we introduce
DexVLG, a large Vision-Language-Grasp model for Dexterous grasp pose prediction
aligned with language instructions using single-view RGBD input. To accomplish
this, we generate a dataset of 170 million dexterous grasp poses mapped to
semantic parts across 174,000 objects in simulation, paired with detailed
part-level captions. This large-scale dataset, named DexGraspNet 3.0, is used
to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong
zero-shot generalization capabilities-achieving over 76% zero-shot execution
success rate and state-of-the-art part-grasp accuracy in simulation-and
successful part-aligned grasps on physical objects in real-world scenarios.

crucial for improving situational awareness and enhancing search and rescue
operations. The use of robots in search and rescue has been studied but the
question of where to start robot deployments has not been addressed. This work
addresses the problem of optimally selecting starting locations for robots with
heterogeneous capabilities by formulating a joint optimization problem. To
determine start locations, this work adds a constraint to the ergodic
optimization framework whose minimum assigns robots to start locations. This
becomes a little more challenging when the robots are heterogeneous (equipped
with different sensing and motion modalities) because not all robots start at
the same location, and a more complex adaptation of the aforementioned
constraint is applied. Our method assumes access to potential starting
locations, which can be obtained from expert knowledge or aerial imagery. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our joint optimization approach by
comparing it to baseline methods that use fixed starting locations for all
robots. Our experimental results show significant gains in coverage
performance, with average improvements of 35.98% on synthetic data and 31.91%
on real-world data for homogeneous and heterogeneous teams, in terms of the
ergodic metric.

specializing on the unique needs of robotic unicycles. A unicycle design is
presented which is capable of accelerating/breaking and carrying out a variety
of maneuvers. The proposed path-planning method segments the path into straight

and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

                                        <span>  Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due
to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of
existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that
extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling
for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with
multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language
model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the
articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS
optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically
consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By
leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and
closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient,
scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation.
Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments
demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint
estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of
articulated objects. Additional images and videos are available on the project

mitigating actuation and control challenges by harnessing pre-designed,
embodied dynamic behaviors. This paper presents Flix-Walker, a novel,
untethered, centimeter-scale quadrupedal robot inspired by compliant
under-actuated mechanisms. Flix-Walker employs flexible, helix-shaped beams as
legs, which are actuated by vibrations from just two motors to achieve three
distinct mobility modes. We analyze the actuation parameters required to
generate various locomotion modes through both simulation and prototype
experiments. The effects of system and environmental variations on locomotion
performance are examined, and we propose a generic metric for selecting control
parameters that produce robust and functional motions. Experiments validate the
effectiveness and robustness of these actuation parameters within a closed-loop
control framework, demonstrating reliable trajectory-tracking and
self-navigation capabilities.

                                        <span>  Despite recent remarkable achievements in quadruped control, it remains
challenging to ensure robust and compliant locomotion in the presence of
unforeseen external disturbances. Existing methods prioritize locomotion
robustness over compliance, often leading to stiff, high-frequency motions, and
energy inefficiency. This paper, therefore, presents a two-stage hierarchical
learning framework that can learn to take active reactions to external force
disturbances based on force estimation. In the first stage, a velocity-tracking
policy is trained alongside an auto-encoder to distill historical
proprioceptive features. A neural network-based estimator is learned through
supervised learning, which estimates body velocity and external forces based on
proprioceptive measurements. In the second stage, a compliance action module,
inspired by impedance control, is learned based on the pre-trained encoder and
policy. This module is employed to actively adjust velocity commands in
response to external forces based on real-time force estimates. With the
compliance action module, a quadruped robot can robustly handle minor
disturbances while appropriately yielding to significant forces, thus striking
a balance between robustness and compliance. Simulations and real-world
experiments have demonstrated that our method has superior performance in terms
of robustness, energy efficiency, and safety. Experiment comparison shows that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art RL-based locomotion controllers.
Ablation studies are given to show the critical roles of the compliance action
module.

Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

                                        <span>  Shared control combines human intention with autonomous decision-making, from
low-level safety overrides to high-level task guidance, enabling systems that
adapt to users while ensuring safety and performance. This enhances task
effectiveness and user experience across domains such as assistive robotics,
teleoperation, and autonomous driving. However, existing shared control
methods, based on e.g. Model Predictive Control, Control Barrier Functions, or
learning-based control, struggle with feasibility, scalability, or safety
guarantees, particularly since the user input is unpredictable.
  To address these challenges, we propose an assistive controller framework
based on Constrained Optimal Control Problem that incorporates an
offline-computed Control Invariant Set, enabling online computation of control
actions that ensure feasibility, strict constraint satisfaction, and minimal
override of user intent. Moreover, the framework can accommodate structured
class of non-convex constraints, which are common in real-world scenarios. We
validate the approach through a large-scale user study with 66
participants--one of the most extensive in shared control research--using a
computer game environment to assess task load, trust, and perceived control, in
addition to performance. The results show consistent improvements across all
these aspects without compromising safety and user intent.

                                        <span>  In autonomous driving, recent research has increasingly focused on
collaborative perception based on deep learning to overcome the limitations of
individual perception systems. Although these methods achieve high accuracy,
they rely on high communication bandwidth and require unrestricted access to
each agent's object detection model architecture and parameters. These
constraints pose challenges real-world autonomous driving scenarios, where
communication limitations and the need to safeguard proprietary models hinder
practical implementation. To address this issue, we introduce a novel late
collaborative framework for 3D multi-source and multi-object fusion, which
operates solely on shared 3D bounding box attributes-category, size, position,
and orientation-without necessitating direct access to detection models. Our
framework establishes a new state-of-the-art in late fusion, achieving up to
five times lower position error compared to existing methods. Additionally, it
reduces scale error by a factor of 7.5 and orientation error by half, all while
maintaining perfect 100% precision and recall when fusing detections from
heterogeneous perception systems. These results highlight the effectiveness of
our approach in addressing real-world collaborative perception challenges,
setting a new benchmark for efficient and scalable multi-agent fusion.

                                        <span>  In the future, mobility will be strongly shaped by the increasing use of
digitalization. Not only will individual road users be highly interconnected,
but also the road and associated infrastructure. At that point, a Digital Twin
becomes particularly appealing because, unlike a basic simulation, it offers a
continuous, bilateral connection linking the real and virtual environments.
This paper describes the digital reconstruction used to develop the Digital
Twin of the Test Area Autonomous Driving-Baden-W\"urttemberg (TAF-BW), Germany.
The TAF-BW offers a variety of different road sections, from high-traffic urban
intersections and tunnels to multilane motorways. The test area is equipped
with a comprehensive Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication infrastructure
and multiple intelligent intersections equipped with camera sensors to
facilitate real-time traffic flow monitoring. The generation of authentic data
as input for the Digital Twin was achieved by extracting object lists at the
intersections. This process was facilitated by the combined utilization of
camera images from the intelligent infrastructure and LiDAR sensors mounted on
a test vehicle. Using a unified interface, recordings from real-world
detections of traffic participants can be resimulated. Additionally, the
simulation framework's design and the reconstruction process is discussed. The
resulting framework is made publicly available for download and utilization at:
https://digit4taf-bw.fzi.de The demonstration uses two case studies to
illustrate the application of the digital twin and its interfaces: the analysis
of traffic signal systems to optimize traffic flow and the simulation of
security-related scenarios in the communications sector.

focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

Vehicle-in-the-loop (ViL) tests and digital twins (DTs) are widely used
simulation technologies to facilitate the smooth deployment of controllers to
physical vehicles. However, conventional ViL tests rely on full-size vehicles,
requiring large space and high expenses. Also, physical-model-based DT suffers
from the reality gap caused by modeling imprecision. This paper develops a
comprehensive and practical simulator for testing automated driving controllers
enhanced by scaled physical cars and AI-powered DT models. The scaled cars
allow for saving space and expenses of simulation tests. The AI-powered DT
models ensure superior simulation fidelity. Moreover, the simulator integrates
well with off-the-shelf software and control algorithms, making it easy to
extend. We use a filtered control benchmark with formal safety guarantees to
showcase the capability of the simulator in validating automated driving
controllers. Experimental studies are performed to showcase the efficacy of the
simulator, implying its great potential in validating control solutions for
autonomous vehicles and intelligent traffic.

                                        <span>  Designing effective reward functions is a cornerstone of reinforcement
learning (RL), yet it remains a challenging process due to the inefficiencies
and inconsistencies inherent in conventional reward engineering methodologies.
Recent advances have explored leveraging large language models (LLMs) to
automate reward function design. However, their suboptimal performance in
numerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the
evolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation
resources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with
disproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we
propose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework
that integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and
evaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function
uncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free
identification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward
components. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization
(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance
hyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level
optimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and
the hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between
the reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths
of the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP
across 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments. Our experimental
results demonstrate that URDP not only generates higher-quality reward
functions but also achieves significant improvements in the efficiency of
automated reward design compared to existing approaches.

                                        <span>  Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote
sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making
processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly
automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on
manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the
drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently,
advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied
obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data
collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone
utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance
for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on
camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric
post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera.
The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through
multiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation
capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH)
estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected
challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent
performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic
photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error
(RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 \%) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than
30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 \%). The results provide valuable insights
into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next
steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex
forest environments.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile
robots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent
operation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face
challenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to
concerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT
applications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control
framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback
and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator.
Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into
natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's
understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework
also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the
risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the
refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different
complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework
can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms
baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase
of task complexity.

platforms, like robots and AR devices. However, blindly performing online
calibration for unobservable parameter may lead to unpredictable results. In
the literature, extensive studies have been conducted on the extrinsic
calibration between IMU and camera, from theory to practice. It is well-known
that the observability of extrinsic parameter can be guaranteed under
sufficient motion excitation. Furthermore, the impacts of degenerate motions
are also investigated. Despite these successful analyses, we identify an issue
with respect to the existing observability conclusion. This paper focuses on
the observability investigation for straight line motion, which is a
common-seen and fundamental degenerate motion in applications. We analytically
prove that pure translational straight line motion can lead to the
unobservability of the rotational extrinsic parameter between IMU and camera
(at least one degree of freedom). By correcting the existing observability
conclusion, our novel theoretical finding disseminates more precise principle
to the research community and provides explainable calibration guideline for
practitioners. Our analysis is validated by rigorous theory and experiments.

                                        <span>  Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.

their internal structures is crucial for medical tasks that require precise
targeting, such as robotic biopsies. We introduce LUDO, a method for accurate
low-latency understanding of deformable objects. LUDO reconstructs objects in
their deformed state, including their internal structures, from a single-view
point cloud observation in under 30 ms using occupancy networks. LUDO provides
uncertainty estimates for its predictions. Additionally, it provides
explainability by highlighting key features in its input observations. Both
uncertainty and explainability are important for safety-critical applications
such as surgery. We evaluate LUDO in real-world robotic experiments, achieving
a success rate of 98.9% for puncturing various regions of interest (ROIs)
inside deformable objects. We compare LUDO to a popular baseline and show its
superior ROI localization accuracy, training time, and memory requirements.
LUDO demonstrates the potential to interact with deformable objects without the
need for deformable registration methods.

                                        <span>  Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot
interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often
yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques
reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately
bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a
deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of
freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a
novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this
discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we
conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and
develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese
RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via
Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform
demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and
socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those
generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our
framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model
predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human
affective responses.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense
reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models,
enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing
autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to
leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static
information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To
this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a
triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language
module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language
instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces
visual representations that encompass both current static information and
predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy
learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained
video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation
data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor
actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates
at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning
baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world
manipulation tasks.

designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer
directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup
competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal
sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a
distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that
reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results
demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as
walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots.
Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a
robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference

evaluation benchmarks, accelerating the development of learning-based methods
for robust object grasping. However, most existing datasets exclude deformable
bodies due to the lack of scalable, robust simulation pipelines, limiting the
development of generalizable models for compliant grippers and soft

leverages an optimized Incremental Potential Contact (IPC)-based simulator for
multi-environment data generation, achieving up to 48x speedup while ensuring
efficient, intersection- and inversion-free simulations for compliant grippers

diverse grasp interactions across 1,200 objects and 100,000 grasp poses,

Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural
language instructions and visual cues. It remains challenging due to the
complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large
language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction.
Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to
enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting
and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down
map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further,
this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as
the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction.
Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have successfully
proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving 15.9% and
12.5% improvements (absolute) in Oracle Success Rate (OSR) on AerialVLN-S
dataset.

                                        <span>  Autonomous systems are becoming increasingly prevalent in new vehicles. Due
to their environmental friendliness and their remarkable capability to
significantly enhance road safety, these vehicles have gained widespread
recognition and acceptance in recent years. Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are
intricate systems that incorporate a multitude of sensors and actuators to
interact with the environment autonomously, pervasively, and interactively.
Consequently, numerous studies are currently underway to keep abreast of these
rapid developments. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of
recent advancements in ADS technologies. It provides in-depth insights into the
detailed information about how data and information flow in the distributed
system, including autonomous vehicles and other various supporting services and
entities. Data validation and system requirements are emphasised, such as
security, privacy, scalability, and data ownership, in accordance with
regulatory standards. Finally, several current research directions in the AVs
field will be discussed.

                                        <span>  Realistic Hand manipulation is a key component of immersive virtual reality
(VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture
datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and
finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight,
one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We
present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand
manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention.
Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated
training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger
input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical
interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a
three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning,
Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy
ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user
inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity
reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training
convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's
superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is

                                        <span>  Semantic segmentation and stereo matching, respectively analogous to the
ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of
autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate
networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision
algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and
embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them
within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing
between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in
comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a
tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep
supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined
use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art
joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2
datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the
effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate
its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in
mIoU by over 9%. Our source code will be publicly available at

                                        <span>  Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful model-free
paradigm for learning optimal policies. However, in navigation tasks with
cluttered environments, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration,
especially under sparse rewards or complex dynamics with system disturbances.
To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion planning with
DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively and achieve
desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense reward function
grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state space. This graph
provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal strategies. We
validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating substantial
improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates.

Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot.
This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end
reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code
publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available
through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean
Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on
hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures
as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from
Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality
reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight
phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple
Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces,
disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail
our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low

robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason,
and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown
strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for
handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and
tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin
Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on
the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot
platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1,
Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled
17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based
scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants,
producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating
valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report
outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key

collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

                                        <span>  Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

feedback, whereby a single user can persistently alter LM knowledge and
behavior given only the ability to provide prompts and upvote / downvote
feedback on LM outputs. To implement the attack, the attacker prompts the LM to
stochastically output either a "poisoned" or benign response, then upvotes the
poisoned response or downvotes the benign one. When feedback signals are used
in a subsequent preference tuning behavior, LMs exhibit increased probability
of producing poisoned responses even in contexts without malicious prompts. We
show that this attack can be used to (1) insert factual knowledge the model did
not previously possess, (2) modify code generation patterns in ways that
introduce exploitable security flaws, and (3) inject fake financial news. Our
finding both identifies a new qualitative feature of language model preference
tuning (showing that it even highly restricted forms of preference data can be
used to exert fine-grained control over behavior), and a new attack mechanism
for LMs trained with user feedback (extending work on pretraining-time data
poisoning and deployment-time prompt injection).

accuracy of machine learning systems. However, effectively extracting and
utilizing HOIs remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose
MvHo-IB, a novel multi-view learning framework that integrates both pairwise
interactions and HOIs for diagnostic decision-making, while automatically
compressing task-irrelevant redundant information. MvHo-IB introduces several
key innovations: (1) a principled method that combines O-information from
information theory with a matrix-based Renyi alpha-order entropy estimator to
quantify and extract HOIs, (2) a purpose-built Brain3DCNN encoder to
effectively utilize these interactions, and (3) a new multi-view learning
information bottleneck objective to enhance representation learning.
Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that MvHo-IB achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming previous methods,
including recent hypergraph-based techniques. The implementation of MvHo-IB is

medicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At
training time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on
well-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.
However, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual
descriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are
incomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,
we make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data
available during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates
of treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text
confounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time
but only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address
this problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects
that explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework
leverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to
mitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a
series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
real-world applications.

However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement
learning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model
outputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement
this by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.
However, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce
positive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows
(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems
where it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in
early-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive
samples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such
settings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current
output distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good
positive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a
natural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.
Instead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they
should (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's
likelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we
propose $\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and
modular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the
ground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to
produce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written
CoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.
Experiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final
performance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based
methods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially
struggles the most.

throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

                                        <span>  With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

                                        <span>  Data scientists often formulate predictive modeling tasks involving fuzzy,
hard-to-define concepts, such as the "authenticity" of student writing or the
"healthcare need" of a patient. Yet the process by which data scientists
translate fuzzy concepts into a concrete, proxy target variable remains poorly
understood. We interview fifteen data scientists in education (N=8) and
healthcare (N=7) to understand how they construct target variables for
predictive modeling tasks. Our findings suggest that data scientists construct
target variables through a bricolage process, involving iterative negotiation
between high-level measurement objectives and low-level practical constraints.
Data scientists attempt to satisfy five major criteria for a target variable
through bricolage: validity, simplicity, predictability, portability, and
resource requirements. To achieve this, data scientists adaptively use problem
(re)formulation strategies, such as swapping out one candidate target variable
for another when the first fails to meet certain criteria (e.g.,
predictability), or composing multiple outcomes into a single target variable
to capture a more holistic set of modeling objectives. Based on our findings,
we present opportunities for future HCI, CSCW, and ML research to better
support the art and science of target variable construction.

relationship between an individual's covariates and the onset time of an event
of interest (e.g., death). It is important for survival models to be
well-calibrated (i.e., for their predicted probabilities to be close to
ground-truth probabilities) because badly calibrated systems can result in
erroneous clinical decisions. Existing survival models are typically calibrated
at the population level only, and thus run the risk of being poorly calibrated
for one or more minority subpopulations. We propose a model called GRADUATE
that achieves multicalibration by ensuring that all subpopulations are
well-calibrated too. GRADUATE frames multicalibration as a constrained
optimization problem, and optimizes both calibration and discrimination
in-training to achieve a good balance between them. We mathematically prove
that the optimization method used yields a solution that is both near-optimal
and feasible with high probability. Empirical comparisons against
state-of-the-art baselines on real-world clinical datasets demonstrate
GRADUATE's efficacy. In a detailed analysis, we elucidate the shortcomings of
the baselines vis-a-vis GRADUATE's strengths.

                                        <span>  In non-truthful auctions such as first-price and all-pay auctions, the
independent strategic behaviors of bidders, with the corresponding equilibrium
notion -- Bayes Nash equilibria -- are notoriously difficult to characterize
and can cause undesirable outcomes. An alternative approach to designing better
auction systems is to coordinate the bidders: let a mediator make
incentive-compatible recommendations of correlated bidding strategies to the
bidders, namely, implementing a Bayes correlated equilibrium (BCE). The
implementation of BCE, however, requires knowledge of the distribution of
bidders' private valuations, which is often unavailable. We initiate the study
of the sample complexity of learning Bayes correlated equilibria in
non-truthful auctions. We prove that the BCEs in a large class of non-truthful
auctions, including first-price and all-pay auctions, can be learned with a
polynomial number $\tilde O(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^2})$ of samples from the
bidders' value distributions. Our technique is a reduction to the problem of
estimating bidders' expected utility from samples, combined with an analysis of
the pseudo-dimension of the class of all monotone bidding strategies of
bidders.

exceptional enhancement performance with computationally lightweight
architectures for stationary speakers of known directions. However, to maintain
this performance in dynamic scenarios, resource-intensive data-driven tracking
algorithms become necessary to provide precise spatial guidance conditioned on
the initial direction of a target speaker. As this additional computational
overhead hinders application in resource-constrained scenarios such as
real-time speech enhancement, we present a novel strategy utilizing a
low-complexity tracking algorithm in the form of a particle filter instead.
Assuming a causal, sequential processing style, we introduce temporal feedback
to leverage the enhanced speech signal of the spatially selective filter to
compensate for the limited modeling capabilities of the particle filter.
Evaluation on a synthetic dataset illustrates how the autoregressive interplay
between both algorithms drastically improves tracking accuracy and leads to
strong enhancement performance. A listening test with real-world recordings
complements these findings by indicating a clear trend towards our proposed
self-steering pipeline as preferred choice over comparable methods.

                                        <span>  Recently, recurrent models such as state space models and linear attention
have become popular due to their linear complexity in the sequence length.
Thanks to their recurrent nature, in principle they can process arbitrarily
long sequences, but their performance sometimes drops considerably beyond their
training context lengths-i.e. they fail to length generalize. In this work, we
provide comprehensive empirical and theoretical analysis to support the
unexplored states hypothesis, which posits that models fail to length
generalize when during training they are only exposed to a limited subset of
the distribution of all attainable states (i.e. states that would be attained
if the recurrence was applied to long sequences). Furthermore, we investigate
simple training interventions that aim to increase the coverage of the states
that the model is trained on, e.g. by initializing the state with Gaussian
noise or with the final state of a different input sequence. With only 500
post-training steps ($\sim 0.1\%$ of the pre-training budget), these
interventions enable length generalization for sequences that are orders of
magnitude longer than the training context (e.g. $2k\longrightarrow 128k$) and
show improved performance in long context tasks, thus presenting a simple and
efficient way to enable robust length generalization in general recurrent
models.

make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

                                        <span>  Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

                                        <span>  We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar
price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$
that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum.
We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion
$\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly
determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty
(OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T +
\frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For
general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT
}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm
that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant
that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online
methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight
regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline
data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with
biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.

model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in
${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that
separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This
problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to
machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a
vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the
origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the
minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown
variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation
of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust
alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as
support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification
tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.

proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this

learning in bridging heterogeneous biological data modalities. Building on this
paradigm, we propose HIPPO (HIerarchical Protein-Protein interaction prediction
across Organisms), a hierarchical contrastive framework for protein-protein
interaction(PPI) prediction, where protein sequences and their hierarchical
attributes are aligned through multi-tiered biological representation matching.
The proposed approach incorporates hierarchical contrastive loss functions that
emulate the structured relationship among functional classes of proteins. The
framework adaptively incorporates domain and family knowledge through a
data-driven penalty mechanism, enforcing consistency between the learned
embedding space and the intrinsic hierarchy of protein functions. Experiments
on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIPPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods and showing robustness in low-data
regimes. Notably, the model demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability to
other species without retraining, enabling reliable PPI prediction and
functional inference even in less characterized or rare organisms where
experimental data are limited. Further analysis reveals that hierarchical
feature fusion is critical for capturing conserved interaction determinants,
such as binding motifs and functional annotations. This work advances

                                        <span>  Dockless e-scooters, a key micromobility service, have emerged as
eco-friendly and flexible urban transport alternatives. These services improve
first and last-mile connectivity, reduce congestion and emissions, and
complement public transport for short-distance travel. However, effective
management of these services depends on accurate demand prediction, which is
crucial for optimal fleet distribution and infrastructure planning. While
previous studies have focused on analyzing spatial or temporal factors in
isolation, this study introduces a framework that integrates spatial, temporal,
and network dependencies for improved micromobility demand forecasting. This
integration enhances accuracy while providing deeper insights into urban
micromobility usage patterns. Our framework improves demand prediction accuracy
by 27 to 49% over baseline models, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing
micromobility demand patterns. These findings support data-driven micromobility
management, enabling optimized fleet distribution, cost reduction, and
sustainable urban planning.

                                        <span>  Deep reinforcement learning for continuous control has recently achieved
impressive progress. However, existing methods often suffer from primacy bias,
a tendency to overfit early experiences stored in the replay buffer, which
limits an RL agent's sample efficiency and generalizability. In contrast,
humans are less susceptible to such bias, partly due to infantile amnesia,
where the formation of new neurons disrupts early memory traces, leading to the
forgetting of initial experiences. Inspired by this dual processes of
forgetting and growing in neuroscience, in this paper, we propose Forget and
Grow (FoG), a new deep RL algorithm with two mechanisms introduced. First,
Experience Replay Decay (ER Decay) "forgetting early experience", which
balances memory by gradually reducing the influence of early experiences.
Second, Network Expansion, "growing neural capacity", which enhances agents'
capability to exploit the patterns of existing data by dynamically adding new
parameters during training. Empirical results on four major continuous control
benchmarks with more than 40 tasks demonstrate the superior performance of FoG
against SoTA existing deep RL algorithms, including BRO, SimBa, and TD-MPC2.

                                        <span>  Federated learning (FL) mechanisms typically require each client to transfer
their weights to a central server, irrespective of how useful they are. In
order to avoid wasteful data transfer costs from clients to the central server,
we propose the use of consensus based protocols to identify a subset of clients
with most useful model weights at each data transfer step. First, we explore
the application of existing fluid democracy protocols to FL from a performance
standpoint, comparing them with traditional one-person-one-vote (also known as
1p1v or FedAvg). We propose a new fluid democracy protocol named
viscous-retained democracy that always does better than 1p1v under the same
assumptions as existing fluid democracy protocols while also not allowing for
influence accumulation. Secondly, we identify weaknesses of fluid democracy
protocols from an adversarial lens in terms of their dependence on topology
and/ or number of adversaries required to negatively impact the global model
weights. To this effect, we propose an algorithm (FedVRD) that dynamically
limits the effect of adversaries while minimizing cost by leveraging the
delegation topology.

                                        <span>  This study investigates how Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) can
improve dynamic pricing strategies in supply chains, particularly in contexts
where traditional ERP systems rely on static, rule-based approaches that
overlook strategic interactions among market actors. While recent research has
applied reinforcement learning to pricing, most implementations remain
single-agent and fail to model the interdependent nature of real-world supply
chains. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the performance of three
MARL algorithms: MADDPG, MADQN, and QMIX against static rule-based baselines,
within a simulated environment informed by real e-commerce transaction data and
a LightGBM demand prediction model. Results show that rule-based agents achieve
near-perfect fairness (Jain's Index: 0.9896) and the highest price stability
(volatility: 0.024), but they fully lack competitive dynamics. Among MARL
agents, MADQN exhibits the most aggressive pricing behaviour, with the highest
volatility and the lowest fairness (0.5844). MADDPG provides a more balanced
approach, supporting market competition (share volatility: 9.5 pp) while
maintaining relatively high fairness (0.8819) and stable pricing. These
findings suggest that MARL introduces emergent strategic behaviour not captured
by static pricing rules and may inform future developments in dynamic pricing.

                                        <span>  Next activity prediction represents a fundamental challenge for optimizing
business processes in service-oriented architectures such as microservices
environments, distributed enterprise systems, and cloud-native platforms, which
enables proactive resource allocation and dynamic service composition. Despite
the prevalence of sequence-based methods, these approaches fail to capture
non-sequential relationships that arise from parallel executions and
conditional dependencies. Even though graph-based approaches address structural
preservation, they suffer from homogeneous representations and static
structures that apply uniform modeling strategies regardless of individual
process complexity characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce
RLHGNN, a novel framework that transforms event logs into heterogeneous process
graphs with three distinct edge types grounded in established process mining
theory. Our approach creates four flexible graph structures by selectively
combining these edges to accommodate different process complexities, and
employs reinforcement learning formulated as a Markov Decision Process to
automatically determine the optimal graph structure for each specific process
instance. RLHGNN then applies heterogeneous graph convolution with
relation-specific aggregation strategies to effectively predict the next
activity. This adaptive methodology enables precise modeling of both sequential
and non-sequential relationships in service interactions. Comprehensive
evaluation on six real-world datasets demonstrates that RLHGNN consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, it maintains an inference
latency of approximately 1 ms per prediction, representing a highly practical
solution suitable for real-time business process monitoring applications. The

computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

                                        <span>  Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical imaging, yet its adoption is
constrained by data scarcity and privacy regulations, limiting access to
diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

also favorable manufacturability, stability, and safety profiles for clinical
effectiveness. These properties are collectively called `developability'. To
enable a computational framework for optimizing antibody sequences for
favorable developability, we introduce a guided discrete diffusion model
trained on natural paired heavy- and light-chain sequences from the Observed
Antibody Space (OAS) and quantitative developability measurements for 246
clinical-stage antibodies. To steer generation toward biophysically viable
candidates, we integrate a Soft Value-based Decoding in Diffusion (SVDD) Module
that biases sampling without compromising naturalness. In unconstrained
sampling, our model reproduces global features of both the natural repertoire
and approved therapeutics, and under SVDD guidance we achieve significant
enrichment in predicted developability scores over unguided baselines. When
combined with high-throughput developability assays, this framework enables an
iterative, ML-driven pipeline for designing antibodies that satisfy binding and
biophysical criteria in tandem.

                                        <span>  Speculative decoding generally dictates having a small, efficient draft model
that is either pretrained or distilled offline to a particular target model
series, for instance, Llama or Qwen models. However, within online deployment
settings, there are two major challenges: 1) usage of a target model that is
incompatible with the draft model; 2) expectation of latency improvements over
usage and time. In this work, we propose OmniDraft, a unified framework that
enables a single draft model to operate with any target model and adapt
dynamically to user data. We introduce an online n-gram cache with hybrid
distillation fine-tuning to address the cross-vocabulary mismatch across draft
and target models; and further improve decoding speed by leveraging adaptive
drafting techniques. OmniDraft is particularly suitable for on-device LLM
applications where model cost, efficiency and user customization are the major
points of contention. This further highlights the need to tackle the above
challenges and motivates the \textit{``one drafter for all''} paradigm. We
showcase the proficiency of the OmniDraft framework by performing online
learning on math reasoning, coding and text generation tasks. Notably,
OmniDraft enables a single Llama-68M model to pair with various target models
including Vicuna-7B, Qwen2-7B and Llama3-8B models for speculative decoding;
and additionally provides up to 1.5-2x speedup.

                                        <span>  Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

reinforcement learning by examining existing principled, information-theoretic
approaches to intrinsic motivation. Specifically, we focus on a class of
exploration bonuses that targets epistemic uncertainty rather than the
aleatoric noise inherent in the environment. We prove that these bonuses
naturally signal epistemic information gains and converge to zero once the
agent becomes sufficiently certain about the environment's dynamics and
rewards, thereby aligning exploration with genuine knowledge gaps. Our analysis
provides formal guarantees for IG-based approaches, which previously lacked
theoretical grounding. To enable practical use, we also discuss tractable
approximations via sparse variational Gaussian Processes, Deep Kernels and Deep
Ensemble models. We then outline a general framework - Predictive Trajectory
Sampling with Bayesian Exploration (PTS-BE) - which integrates model-based
planning with information-theoretic bonuses to achieve sample-efficient deep
exploration. We empirically demonstrate that PTS-BE substantially outperforms
other baselines across a variety of environments characterized by sparse
rewards and/or purely exploratory tasks.

                                        <span>  We introduce a new hierarchical deep learning framework for recursive
higher-order meta-learning that enables neural networks (NNs) to construct,
solve, and generalise across hierarchies of tasks. Central to this approach is
a generative mechanism that creates \emph{virtual tasks} -- synthetic problem
instances designed to enable the meta-learner to learn \emph{soft constraints}
and unknown generalisable rules across related tasks. Crucially, this enables
the framework to generate its own informative, task-grounded datasets thereby
freeing machine learning (ML) training from the limitations of relying entirely
on human-generated data. By actively exploring the virtual point landscape and
seeking out tasks lower-level learners find difficult, the meta-learner
iteratively refines constraint regions. This enhances inductive biases,
regularises the adaptation process, and produces novel, unanticipated tasks and
constraints required for generalisation. Each meta-level of the hierarchy
corresponds to a progressively abstracted generalisation of problems solved at
lower levels, enabling a structured and interpretable learning progression. By
interpreting meta-learners as category-theoretic \emph{functors} that generate
and condition a hierarchy of subordinate learners, we establish a compositional
structure that supports abstraction and knowledge transfer across progressively
generalised tasks. The category-theoretic perspective unifies existing
meta-learning models and reveals how learning processes can be transformed and
compared through functorial relationships, while offering practical design
principles for structuring meta-learning. We speculate this architecture may
underpin the next generation of NNs capable of autonomously generating novel,
instructive tasks and their solutions, thereby advancing ML towards general
artificial intelligence.

                                        <span>  Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological
studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The
reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR
data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including
misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they
are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality
assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess
data fitness for research.
  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit
testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data
quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking
Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test
generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a
test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework
that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.
  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and
SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These
tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We
present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of
reference grounding and value accuracy.
  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable
context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to
improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges
from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further
development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.

protein variants, traditionally relying on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs).
This approach assumes that naturally occurring variants are fit, an assumption
challenged by pharmacogenomics, where some pharmacogenes experience low
evolutionary pressure. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets provide an
alternative by offering quantitative fitness scores for variants. In this work,
we propose a transformer-based matrix variational auto-encoder (matVAE) with a
structured prior and evaluate its performance on 33 DMS datasets corresponding
to 26 drug target and ADME proteins from the ProteinGym benchmark. Our model
trained on MSAs (matVAE-MSA) outperforms the state-of-the-art DeepSequence
model in zero-shot prediction on DMS datasets, despite using an order of
magnitude fewer parameters and requiring less computation at inference time. We
also compare matVAE-MSA to matENC-DMS, a model of similar capacity trained on
DMS data, and find that the latter performs better on supervised prediction
tasks. Additionally, incorporating AlphaFold-generated structures into our
transformer model further improves performance, achieving results comparable to
DeepSequence trained on MSAs and finetuned on DMS. These findings highlight the
potential of DMS datasets to replace MSAs without significant loss in
predictive performance, motivating further development of DMS datasets and
exploration of their relationships to enhance variant effect prediction.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

use as fast physics emulators. In the context of image and video generation,
this computational drawback has been addressed by generating in the latent
space of an autoencoder instead of the pixel space. In this work, we
investigate whether a similar strategy can be effectively applied to the
emulation of dynamical systems and at what cost. We find that the accuracy of
latent-space emulation is surprisingly robust to a wide range of compression
rates (up to 1000x). We also show that diffusion-based emulators are
consistently more accurate than non-generative counterparts and compensate for
uncertainty in their predictions with greater diversity. Finally, we cover
practical design choices, spanning from architectures to optimizers, that we
found critical to train latent-space emulators.

emphasize the critical need for implementing in-vehicle cyber security measures
such as intrusion detection and response systems. The continuous advancement of
attack scenarios further highlights the need for adaptive detection mechanisms
that can detect evolving, unknown, and complex threats. The effective use of
ML-driven techniques can help address this challenge. However, constraints on
implementing diverse attack scenarios on test vehicles due to safety, cost, and
ethical considerations result in a scarcity of data representing attack
scenarios. This limitation necessitates alternative efficient and effective
methods for generating high-quality attack-representing data. This paper
presents a context-aware attack data generator that generates attack inputs and
corresponding in-vehicle network log, i.e., controller area network (CAN) log,
representing various types of attack including denial of service (DoS), fuzzy,
spoofing, suspension, and replay attacks. It utilizes parameterized attack
models augmented with CAN message decoding and attack intensity adjustments to
configure the attack scenarios with high similarity to real-world scenarios and
promote variability. We evaluate the practicality of the generated
attack-representing data within an intrusion detection system (IDS) case study,
in which we develop and perform an empirical evaluation of two deep neural
network IDS models using the generated data. In addition to the efficiency and
scalability of the approach, the performance results of IDS models, high
detection and classification capabilities, validate the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated data as well. In this experience study, we also
elaborate on the aspects influencing the fidelity of the data to real-world
scenarios and provide insights into its application.

security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

                                        <span>  Purpose: The primary aim of this study is to enhance fault diagnosis in
induction machines by leveraging the Pad\'e Approximant Neuron (PAON) model.
While accelerometers and microphones are standard in motor condition
monitoring, deep learning models with nonlinear neuron architectures offer
promising improvements in diagnostic performance. This research addresses the
question: Can Pad\'e Approximant Neural Networks (Pad\'eNets) outperform
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Self-Organized
Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs) in diagnosing electrical and mechanical
faults using vibration and acoustic data?
  Methods: We evaluate and compare the diagnostic capabilities of three deep
learning architectures: one-dimensional CNNs, Self-ONNs, and Pad\'eNets. These
models are tested on the University of Ottawa's publicly available
constant-speed induction motor datasets, which include both vibration and
acoustic sensor data. The Pad\'eNet model is designed to introduce enhanced
nonlinearity and is compatible with unbounded activation functions such as
Leaky ReLU.
  Results and Conclusion: Pad\'eNets consistently outperformed the baseline
models, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 99.96%, 98.26%, 97.61%, and 98.33%
for accelerometers 1, 2, 3, and the acoustic sensor, respectively. The enhanced
nonlinearity of Pad\'eNets, together with their compatibility with unbounded
activation functions, significantly improves fault diagnosis performance in
induction motor condition monitoring.

                                        <span>  Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied
supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the
same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation
frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This
overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences
in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a
popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in
training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying
assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this
paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature,
highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and
noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have
addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual
framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance
selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the
integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay
a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the
complexities of real-world annotation.

efficient inference on resource-constrained hardware. We extend them with a
trainable, differentiable interconnect whose parameter count remains constant
as input width grows, allowing DBNs to scale to far wider layers than earlier
learnable-interconnect designs while preserving their advantageous accuracy. To
further reduce model size, we propose two complementary pruning stages: an
SAT-based logic equivalence pass that removes redundant gates without affecting
performance, and a similarity-based, data-driven pass that outperforms a
magnitude-style greedy baseline and offers a superior compression-accuracy
trade-off.

                                        <span>  Layer-wise normalization (LN) is an essential component of virtually all
transformer-based large language models. While its effects on training
stability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.
Additionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing
additional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual
model components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every
GPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03
cross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in
language modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN
removal grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger
models is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.
Furthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct
logit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,
while the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We
also confirm that GPT-2's "confidence neurons" are inactive in the LN-free
models. Our work clarifies the role of LN layers in language modeling, showing
that GPT-2-class models can function without LN layers. We hope that our
LN-free analogs of the GPT-2 family of models will enable more precise
interpretability research and improve our understanding of language models.

MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result
on MLE-bench lite, increasing the success rate of achieving a Kaggle medal from
39.6% to 47.7%. Our investigation underscores the importance of jointly

advancing automated machine learning.

success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

                                        <span>  The text-to-SQL task is an active challenge in Natural Language Processing.
Many existing solutions focus on using black-box language models extended with
specialized components within customized end-to-end text-to-SQL pipelines.
While these solutions use both closed-source proprietary language models and
coding-oriented open-source models, there is a lack of research regarding
SQL-specific generative models. At the same time, recent advancements in
self-correcting generation strategies show promise for improving the
capabilities of existing architectures. The application of these concepts to
the text-to-SQL task remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce RetrySQL,
a new approach to training text-to-SQL generation models. We prepare reasoning
steps for reference SQL queries and then corrupt them to create retry data that
contains both incorrect and corrected steps, divided with a special token. We
continuously pre-train an open-source coding model with this data and
demonstrate that retry steps yield an improvement of up to 4 percentage points
in both overall and challenging execution accuracy metrics, compared to
pre-training without retry data. Additionally, we confirm that supervised
fine-tuning with LoRA is ineffective for learning from retry data and that
full-parameter pre-training is a necessary requirement for that task. We
showcase that the self-correcting behavior is learned by the model and the
increase in downstream accuracy metrics is a result of this additional skill.
Finally, we incorporate RetrySQL-trained models into the full text-to-SQL
pipeline and showcase that they are competitive in terms of execution accuracy
with proprietary models that contain orders of magnitude more parameters.
RetrySQL demonstrates that self-correction can be learned in the text-to-SQL
task and provides a novel way of improving generation accuracy for SQL-oriented
language models.

                                        <span>  Cross-subject motor imagery (CS-MI) classification in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs) is a challenging task due to the significant variability in
Electroencephalography (EEG) patterns across different individuals. This
variability often results in lower classification accuracy compared to
subject-specific models, presenting a major barrier to developing
calibration-free BCIs suitable for real-world applications. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that significantly enhances cross-subject MI
classification performance through optimized preprocessing and deep learning
techniques. Our approach involves direct classification of Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT)-transformed EEG data, optimized STFT parameters, and a
balanced batching strategy during training of a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN). This approach is uniquely validated across four different datasets,
including three widely-used benchmark datasets leading to substantial
improvements in cross-subject classification, achieving 67.60% on the BCI
Competition IV Dataset 1 (IV-1), 65.96% on Dataset 2A (IV-2A), and 80.22% on
Dataset 2B (IV-2B), outperforming state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, we
systematically investigate the classification performance using MI windows
ranging from the full 4-second window to 1-second windows. These results
establish a new benchmark for generalizable, calibration-free MI classification
in addition to contributing a robust open-access dataset to advance research in
this domain.

                                        <span>  Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

                                        <span>  We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that
directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target
miscoverage rate $\alpha > 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an
algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in
[0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is,
$y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while
maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the
intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of
constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input
sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct
intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length
upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight.
For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a
$\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval
achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more
mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and
the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching
algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of
mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to
an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to
the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single
algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and
optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an
algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.

                                        <span>  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

                                        <span>  Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are an emerging architecture for building
machine learning models. KANs are based on the theoretical foundation of the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Theorem and its expansions, which provide an exact
representation of a multi-variate continuous bounded function as the
composition of a limited number of univariate continuous functions. While such
theoretical results are powerful, their use as a representation learning
alternative to a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) hinges on the ad-hoc choice of
the number of bases modeling each of the univariate functions. In this work, we
show how to address this problem by adaptively learning a potentially infinite
number of bases for each univariate function during training. We therefore
model the problem as a variational inference optimization problem. Our
proposal, called InfinityKAN, which uses backpropagation, extends the potential
applicability of KANs by treating an important hyperparameter as part of the
learning process.

Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

                                        <span>  Federated Graph Learning (FGL) combines the privacy-preserving capabilities
of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available
at https://github.com/Wonder7racer/S2FGL.git.

using in-domain datasets. However, they seldom evaluate how they generalize
across diverse speech contexts. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking
seven Akan ASR models built on transformer architectures, such as Whisper and
Wav2Vec2, using four Akan speech corpora to determine their performance. These
datasets encompass various domains, including culturally relevant image
descriptions, informal conversations, biblical scripture readings, and
spontaneous financial dialogues. A comparison of the word error rate and
character error rate highlighted domain dependency, with models performing
optimally only within their training domains while showing marked accuracy
degradation in mismatched scenarios. This study also identified distinct error
behaviors between the Whisper and Wav2Vec2 architectures. Whereas fine-tuned
Whisper Akan models led to more fluent but potentially misleading transcription
errors, Wav2Vec2 produced more obvious yet less interpretable outputs when
encountering unfamiliar inputs. This trade-off between readability and
transparency in ASR errors should be considered when selecting architectures
for low-resource language (LRL) applications. These findings highlight the need
for targeted domain adaptation techniques, adaptive routing strategies, and
multilingual training frameworks for Akan and other LRLs.

                                        <span>  Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous
vehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of
agents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially
dangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art
deep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy
on public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,
they often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading
to inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the
efficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this
work fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using
preference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference
rankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our
experiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show
that we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally
sacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess
computational requirements at inference time.

across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This
dependence on annotated data has driven the curation of numerous large-scale
wildlife datasets. This study investigates self-supervised learning
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the
experimental results shows that self-supervised models are more robust even
with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

                                        <span>  Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

expressive generative priors for clean speech. Existing approaches guide the
reverse diffusion process using noisy speech through an approximate,
noise-perturbed likelihood score, combined with the unconditional score via a
trade-off hyperparameter. In this work, we propose two alternative algorithms
that directly model the conditional reverse transition distribution of
diffusion states. The first method integrates the diffusion prior with the
observation model in a principled way, removing the need for hyperparameter
tuning. The second defines a diffusion process over the noisy speech itself,
yielding a fully tractable and exact likelihood score. Experiments on the
WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND datasets demonstrate improved enhancement metrics
and greater robustness to domain shifts compared to both supervised and
unsupervised baselines.

standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these
methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the
conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first
considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling
matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the
unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP)
and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate
posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed
block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than
existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational
costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides
competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering
practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.

Random Access Memory systems is crucial but often computationally demanding or
model-reliant. This paper introduces a data-driven framework employing learned
latent signal representations for efficient signal integrity evaluation,
coupled with a model-free Advantage Actor-Critic reinforcement learning agent
for parameter optimization. The latent representation captures vital signal
integrity features, offering a fast alternative to direct eye diagram analysis
during optimization, while the reinforcement learning agent derives optimal
equalizer settings without explicit system models. Applied to industry-standard
Dynamic Random Access Memory waveforms, the method achieved significant
eye-opening window area improvements: 42.7\% for cascaded Continuous-Time
Linear Equalizer and Decision Feedback Equalizer structures, and 36.8\% for
Decision Feedback Equalizer-only configurations. These results demonstrate
superior performance, computational efficiency, and robust generalization
across diverse Dynamic Random Access Memory units compared to existing
techniques. Core contributions include an efficient latent signal integrity
metric for optimization, a robust model-free reinforcement learning strategy,
and validated superior performance for complex equalizer architectures.

dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

                                        <span>  Path planning algorithms aim to compute a collision-free path, and many works
focus on finding the optimal distance path. However, for some applications, a
more suitable approach is to balance response time, safety of the paths, and
path length. In this context, a skeleton map is a useful tool in graph-based
schemes, as it provides an intrinsic representation of free configuration
space. However, skeletonization algorithms are very resource-intensive, being
primarily oriented towards image processing tasks. We propose an efficient
path-planning methodology that finds safe paths within an acceptable processing
time. This methodology leverages a Deep Denoising Auto-Encoder (DDAE) based on
U-Net architecture to compute a skeletonized version of the navigation map,
which we refer to as SkelUnet. The SkelUnet network facilitates exploration of
the entire workspace through one-shot sampling (OSS), as opposed to the
iterative process used by exact algorithms or the probabilistic sampling
process. SkelUnet is trained and tested on a dataset consisting of 12,500
bi-dimensional dungeon maps. The motion planning methodology is evaluated in a
simulation environment for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) using 250
previously unseen maps, and assessed with various navigation metrics to
quantify the navigability of the computed paths. The results demonstrate that
using SkelUnet to construct a roadmap offers significant advantages, such as
connecting all regions of free workspace, providing safer paths, and reducing
processing times. These characteristics make this method particularly suitable
for mobile service robots in structured environments.

                                        <span>  Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the most common signals used to
capture the electrical activity of the brain, and the decoding of EEG, to
acquire the user intents, has been at the forefront of brain-computer/machine
interfaces (BCIs/BMIs) research. Compared to traditional EEG analysis methods
with machine learning, the advent of deep learning approaches have gradually
revolutionized the field by providing an end-to-end long-cascaded architecture,
which can learn more discriminative features automatically. Among these,
Transformer is renowned for its strong handling capability of sequential data
by the attention mechanism, and the application of Transformers in various EEG
processing tasks is increasingly prevalent. This article delves into a relevant
survey, summarizing the latest application of Transformer models in EEG
decoding since it appeared. The evolution of the model architecture is followed
to sort and organize the related advances, in which we first elucidate the
fundamentals of the Transformer that benefits EEG decoding and its direct
application. Then, the common hybrid architectures by integrating basic
Transformer with other deep learning techniques
(convolutional/recurrent/graph/spiking neural netwo-rks, generative adversarial
networks, diffusion models, etc.) is overviewed in detail. The research
advances of applying the modified intrinsic structures of customized
Transformer have also been introduced. Finally, the current challenges and
future development prospects in this rapidly evolving field are discussed. This
paper aims to help readers gain a clear understanding of the current state of
Transformer applications in EEG decoding and to provide valuable insights for
future research endeavors.

language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al.
(2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,
which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide
the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the
target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base
model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward
signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through
self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more
aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.

                                        <span>  Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

                                        <span>  Recommendation systems have become essential in modern music streaming
platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

                                        <span>  Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks.
However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring
general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains
challenging. Existing work pays limited attention to the fine-grained
functional layout semantics in urban regions, limiting their ability to capture
transferable knowledge across regions. Further, inadequate handling of the
unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks may
also hinder effective task adaptation. In this paper, we propose a
$\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion
$\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$)
for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban
region graph and develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to
capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of entity interactions.
This model pre-trains knowledge-rich region embeddings using contrastive
learning and multi-view learning methods. To further refine these
representations, we design two graph-based prompting methods: a
manually-defined prompt to incorporate explicit task knowledge and a
task-learnable prompt to discover hidden knowledge, which enhances the
adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks. Extensive experiments on
various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework.

                                        <span>  Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming
-- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's
intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in
future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is
therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to
model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning
evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are
prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of
ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present
eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason
about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We
demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability
safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost
certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We
run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show
concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.

enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However,
traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for
handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large
Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are
ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems
transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating
autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a
dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to
interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also
introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational
depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of
open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only
significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the
dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources,

of machine learning models and are widely used as tools for privacy assessment,
auditing, and machine unlearning. While prior MIA research has primarily
focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either
by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate
privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different
attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between
multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the
reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this
paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel
framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments
reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their
broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we
propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the
strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities. This
framework not only enables the construction of more powerful attacks but also
provides a more robust and comprehensive methodology for privacy evaluation.

                                        <span>  Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the shortcut to dominate over sub-layer outputs in the residual
connection and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple
technique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works
by scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients
unchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the
gradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive
experiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves
consistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also
shows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings. Our code is available at

                                        <span>  Postprandial hyperglycemia, marked by the blood glucose level exceeding the
normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression
toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A
key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the
postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance
based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity
level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could
allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal
glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning
solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data
processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to
predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and
recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week
clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the
proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data,
and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from
wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work
logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose
pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error
(NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology
provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models.
Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3%
and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help
avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations. Code

                                        <span>  Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all
mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors.
This approach is problematic when some mistakes are "catastrophic", i.e.,
irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to
minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in
each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe in that round and try
to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe)
while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We also assume that the
agent can transfer knowledge between similar inputs. We first show that in
general, any algorithm either queries the mentor at a linear rate or is nearly
guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy
class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose
regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon
grows. Although our focus is the product of payoffs, we provide matching bounds
for the typical additive regret. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable
in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of
catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.

                                        <span>  The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to
the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture
essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and
spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we
present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated
dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic
panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset
includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a
terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset
were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate
individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples.
This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a
structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the
maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step
optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We
conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in
segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata
annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and
quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k
points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational
tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for
AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in
agricultural research.

Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of
inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the
significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing
number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource
allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as
health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these
sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall
inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to
quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups
using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate
inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our
approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and
Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting
discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of
the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a
government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both
among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and
non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in
policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach
can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning
systems.

                                        <span>  We study language generation in the limit - introduced by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [KM24] - building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin
[Ang79]. [KM24]'s main result is an algorithm for generating from any countable
language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually generates
unseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth,
i.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces
different notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is
possible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set
of results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of
breadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very
flexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance,
showing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a
higher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other
languages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable
generators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary
but finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such
generators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that
generation with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when
stability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate
breadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich
interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.

                                        <span>  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often
yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques
reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately
bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a
deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of
freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a
novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this
discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we
conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and
develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese
RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via
Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform
demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and
socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those
generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our
framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model
predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human
affective responses.

Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and
temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time,
minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg,
Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to
compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for
the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and
validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our
results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with
high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include
camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions
affecting traffic flow.

such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks.
Nevertheless, GNNs outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively.
Existing methods typically compromise to individual pre-defined explainability
measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-sided''
interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that
interprets GNN output by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability
measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto
set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory
measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization
problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms
with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and
removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3)
We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich
the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel
algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for
large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we
experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.

feature selection (UFS) has been an emerging research topic. A tensor structure
is beneficial for mining the relations between different modes and helps
relieve the computation burden. However, while existing methods exploit TD to
preserve the data tensor structure, they do not consider the influence of data
orientation and thus have difficulty in handling orientation-specific data such
as time series. To solve the above problem, we utilize the
orientation-dependent tensor-tensor product from Tensor Singular Value
Decomposition based on *M-product (T-SVDM) and extend the one-dimensional
Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) to a tensor form. The proposed
sparse tensor PCA model can constrain sparsity at the specified mode and yield
sparse tensor principal components, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in
learning feature relations. To ensure fast convergence and a flexible
description of feature correlation, we develop a convex version specially
designed for general UFS tasks and propose an efficient slice-by-slice
algorithm that performs dual optimization in the transform domain. Experimental
results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and remarkable
computational efficiency of the proposed method for tensor data of diverse
structures over the state-of-the-art. When transform axes align with feature
distribution patterns, our method is promising for various applications. The
codes related to our proposed methods and the experiments are available at

                                        <span>  Driven by recent breakthrough advances in neural representation learning,
approximate near-neighbor (ANN) search over vector embeddings has emerged as a
critical computational workload. With the introduction of the seminal
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm, graph-based indexes have
established themselves as the overwhelmingly dominant paradigm for efficient
and scalable ANN search. As the name suggests, HNSW searches a layered
hierarchical graph to quickly identify neighborhoods of similar points to a
given query vector. But is this hierarchy even necessary? A rigorous
experimental analysis to answer this question would provide valuable insights
into the nature of algorithm design for ANN search and motivate directions for
future work in this increasingly crucial domain. We conduct an extensive
benchmarking study covering more large-scale datasets than prior investigations
of this question. We ultimately find that a flat navigable small world graph
graph retains all of the benefits of HNSW on high-dimensional datasets, with
latency and recall performance essentially \emph{identical} to the original
algorithm but with less memory overhead. Furthermore, we go a step further and
study \emph{why} the hierarchy of HNSW provides no benefit in high dimensions,
hypothesizing that navigable small world graphs contain a well-connected,
frequently traversed ``highway" of hub nodes that maintain the same purported
function as the hierarchical layers. We present compelling empirical evidence
that the \emph{Hub Highway Hypothesis} holds for real datasets and investigate
the mechanisms by which the highway forms. The implications of this hypothesis
may also provide future research directions in developing enhancements to
graph-based ANN search.

                                        <span>  In this work, we present a series of structure transformation attacks on LLM
alignment, where we encode natural language intent using diverse syntax spaces,
ranging from simple structure formats and basic query languages (e.g., SQL) to
new novel spaces and syntaxes created entirely by LLMs. Our extensive
evaluation shows that our simplest attacks can achieve close to a 90% success
rate, even on strict LLMs (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using SOTA alignment
mechanisms. We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive
scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing content
transformations, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals.
  To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including
syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel
syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that
defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we
develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it,
showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing
safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing
harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research
efforts in this direction. As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can
use our attack to easily generate a sample malware and a corpus of fraudulent
SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection.

                                        <span>  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like
Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants
for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts
on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such
robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic
insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups
fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key
requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM
robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily
translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that
are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail
to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models
(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks
interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines
should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To
demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the
robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets
with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into
robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and
2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution
shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the
image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the
best-performing FT method on in-distribution data. Code is provided at

designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer
directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup
competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal
sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a
distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that
reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results
demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as
walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots.
Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a
robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference
optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code

comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The project page is

for causal and time-invariant filters are introduced, and the relations between
them are analyzed. A significant generalization of the convolution theorem that
establishes the equivalence between the fading memory property and the
availability of convolution representations of linear filters is proved. This
result extends a previous similar characterization to a complete array of
weighted norms in the definition of the fading memory property. Additionally,
the main theorem shows that the availability of convolution representations can
be characterized, at least when the codomain is finite-dimensional, not only by
the fading memory property but also by the reunion of two purely topological
notions that are called minimal continuity and minimal fading memory property.
Finally, when the input space and the codomain of a linear functional are
Hilbert spaces, it is shown that minimal continuity and the minimal fading
memory property guarantee the existence of interesting embeddings of the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.

adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations
-- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too
restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is
the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our
machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without
warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which
can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an
adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent
developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates
memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of
magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive
probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.

                                        <span>  Flow Matching (FM) is a recent generative modelling technique: we aim to
learn how to sample from distribution $\mathfrak{X}_1$ by flowing samples from
some distribution $\mathfrak{X}_0$ that is easy to sample from. The key trick
is that this flow field can be trained while conditioning on the end point in
$\mathfrak{X}_1$: given an end point, simply move along a straight line segment
to the end point (Lipman et al. 2022). However, straight line segments are only
well-defined on Euclidean space. Consequently, Chen and Lipman (2023)
generalised the method to FM on Riemannian manifolds, replacing line segments
with geodesics or their spectral approximations. We take an alternative point
of view: we generalise to FM on Lie groups by instead substituting exponential
curves for line segments. This leads to a simple, intrinsic, and fast
implementation for many matrix Lie groups, since the required Lie group
operations (products, inverses, exponentials, logarithms) are simply given by
the corresponding matrix operations. FM on Lie groups could then be used for
generative modelling with data consisting of sets of features (in
$\mathbb{R}^n$) and poses (in some Lie group), e.g. the latent codes of
Equivariant Neural Fields (Wessels et al. 2025).

                                        <span>  We introduce Interleaved Gibbs Diffusion (IGD), a novel generative modeling
framework for discrete-continuous data, focusing on problems with important,
implicit and unspecified constraints in the data. Most prior works on discrete
and discrete-continuous diffusion assume a factorized denoising distribution,
which can hinder the modeling of strong dependencies between random variables
in such problems. We empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in 3-SAT
performance out of the box by switching to a Gibbs-sampling style discrete
diffusion model which does not assume factorizability. Motivated by this, we
introduce IGD which generalizes discrete time Gibbs sampling type Markov chain
for the case of discrete-continuous generation. IGD allows for seamless
integration between discrete and continuous denoisers while theoretically
guaranteeing exact reversal of a suitable forward process. Further, it provides
flexibility in the choice of denoisers, allows conditional generation via
state-space doubling and inference time refinement. Empirical evaluations on
three challenging generation tasks - molecule structures, layouts and tabular
data - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, IGD achieves
state-of-the-art results without relying on domain-specific inductive biases
like equivariant diffusion or auxiliary losses. We explore a wide range of
modeling, and interleaving strategies along with hyperparameters in each of
these problems.

                                        <span>  The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial
optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown
promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key
limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading
to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from
traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated
environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex
scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD),
an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these
limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is
motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions
are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with
simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable
variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN
(mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to
learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we
present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action
spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in
an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms
online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100
solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset
yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the
same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications,
where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.

Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by
leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory
for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order
derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard
matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular
matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed
the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric
perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to
this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the
infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and
deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield
the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract
operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips
researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity
studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep
learning).

which several quantum algorithms have been proposed. We show here that in a
wide range of scenarios these algorithms show no exponential speedup. We
achieve this by rigorously proving that the condition number of a kernel matrix
scales at least linearly with the matrix size under general assumptions on the
data and kernel. We additionally prove that the sparsity and Frobenius norm of
a kernel matrix scale linearly under similar assumptions. The implications for
the quantum algorithms runtime are independent of the complexity of loading
classical data on a quantum computer and also apply to dequantised algorithms.
We supplement our theoretical analysis with numerical verification for popular
kernels in machine learning.

                                        <span>  Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation
(QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is
often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression
due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature
has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or
discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods
remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to
the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics
fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately
address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This
study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs
-- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the
balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly
captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal
regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit
model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and
ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on
complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for
discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.

                                        <span>  This paper studies the long-tailed semi-supervised learning (LTSSL) with
distribution mismatch, where the class distribution of the labeled training
data follows a long-tailed distribution and mismatches with that of the
unlabeled training data. Most existing methods introduce auxiliary classifiers
(experts) to model various unlabeled data distributions and produce
pseudo-labels, but the expertises of various experts are not fully utilized. We
observe that different experts are good at predicting different intervals of
samples, e.g., long-tailed expert is skilled in samples located in the head
interval and uniform expert excels in samples located in the medium interval.
Therefore, we propose a dynamic expert assignment module that can estimate the
class membership (i.e., head, medium, or tail class) of samples, and
dynamically assigns suitable expert to each sample based on the estimated
membership to produce high-quality pseudo-label in the training phase and
produce prediction in the testing phase. We also theoretically reveal that
integrating different experts' strengths will lead to a smaller generalization
error bound. Moreover, we find that the deeper features are more biased toward
the head class but with more discriminative ability, while the shallower
features are less biased but also with less discriminative ability. We,
therefore, propose a multi-depth feature fusion module to utilize different
depth features to mitigate the model bias. Our method demonstrates its
effectiveness through comprehensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, STL-10-LT,
and SVHN-LT datasets across various settings. The code is available at

migration flows and stocks between 230 countries and regions, spanning the
period from 1990 to the present. Our flow estimates are further disaggregated
by country of birth, providing a comprehensive picture of migration over the
last 35 years. The estimates are obtained by training a deep recurrent neural
network to learn flow patterns from 18 covariates for all countries, including
geographic, economic, cultural, societal, and political information. The
recurrent architecture of the neural network means that the entire past can
influence current migration patterns, allowing us to learn long-range temporal
correlations. By training an ensemble of neural networks and additionally
pushing uncertainty on the covariates through the trained network, we obtain
confidence bounds for all our estimates, allowing researchers to pinpoint the
geographic regions most in need of additional data collection. We validate our
approach on various test sets of unseen data, demonstrating that it
significantly outperforms traditional methods estimating five-year flows while
delivering a significant increase in temporal resolution. The model is fully
open source: all training data, neural network weights, and training code are
made public alongside the migration estimates, providing a valuable resource
for future studies of human migration.

                                        <span>  Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated
significant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the
performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. SSL
frameworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same
audio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those
of their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation.
Therefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it
encodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned
representations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling
(SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives
in SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the
representation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same
speaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method
consistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks
when applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO.
Using SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O,
respectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable
performance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers
intra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations
while exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.

conventional Quantized Artificial Neural Networks (QNNs) due to their
event-driven, spike-based computation. However, prevailing energy evaluations
often oversimplify, focusing on computational aspects while neglecting critical
overheads like comprehensive data movement and memory access. Such
simplifications can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the true energy
benefits of SNNs. This paper presents a rigorous re-evaluation. We establish a
fair baseline by mapping rate-encoded SNNs with $T$ timesteps to functionally
equivalent QNNs with $\lceil \log_2(T+1) \rceil$ bits. This ensures both models
have comparable representational capacities, as well has similar hardware
requirement, enabling meaningful energy comparisons. We introduce a detailed
analytical energy model encompassing core computation and data movement (sparse
and dense activations, weights). Using this model, we systematically explore a
wide parameter space, including intrinsic network characteristics ($T$, spike
rate $s_r$, QNN sparsity $\gamma$, model size $N$, weight bit-level) and
hardware characteristics (memory system and network-on-chip). Our analysis
identifies specific operational regimes where SNNs genuinely offer superior
energy efficiency. For example, under typical neuromorphic hardware conditions,
SNNs with moderate time windows ($T \in [5,10]$) require an average spike rate
($s_r$) below 6.4% to outperform equivalent QNNs. These insights guide the
design of genuinely energy-efficient neural network solutions.

significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

                                        <span>  Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the
data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and
scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways
to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the
resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this
topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying
normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We
focus on binary features and show that their class balances (proportions of
ones) directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect
depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We
demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with
their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of
ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance of the
coefficient estimates. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty
weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we
also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and
provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.

                                        <span>  Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in
online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled
uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in
experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more
efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In
this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of
temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting
transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience
Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present
empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various
environment types, including the Atari-10 benchmark.

                                        <span>  Incurable diseases continue to pose major challenges to global healthcare
systems, with their prevalence shaped by lifestyle, economic, social, and
genetic factors. Among these, kidney disease remains a critical global health
issue, requiring ongoing research to improve early diagnosis and treatment. In
recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown promise in medical imaging and
diagnostics, driving significant progress in automatic kidney cancer (KC)
detection. However, the success of DL models depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which are often limited
and expensive to acquire. Moreover, DL models demand substantial computational
power and storage, restricting their real-world clinical use. To overcome these
barriers, transfer learning (TL) has emerged as an effective approach, enabling
the reuse of pre-trained models from related domains to enhance KC diagnosis.
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for KC
detection, systematically reviewing key methodologies, their advantages, and
limitations, and analyzing their practical performance. It further discusses
challenges in applying TL to medical imaging and highlights emerging trends
that could influence future research. This review demonstrates the
transformative role of TL in precision medicine, particularly oncology, by
improving diagnostic accuracy, lowering computational demands, and supporting
the integration of AI-powered tools in healthcare. The insights provided offer
valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners, paving the way for future
advances in KC diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

statistical estimation performance and computational scalability. We introduce
a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes
the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates
it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss
function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency
in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated
optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a
novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix
multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework
was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating
complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks.
Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a
dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the
ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing
key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of
epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational
scalability in multi-omic data analysis.

                                        <span>  The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted
significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and
biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying
systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with
nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional
causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum
Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any
assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional
independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal
relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We
conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures,
demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly
with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore,
we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment
(KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method
effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling
more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate
that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate
inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical
algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was
validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and
biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing
practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional
approaches have shown significant limitations.

predicting molecular dynamics and properties. To perform equivariant
convolutional-like operations in these architectures one needs Euclidean
invariant kernels on M(3) x M(3). In practice, a handcrafted collection of
invariants is selected, and this collection is then fed into multilayer
perceptrons to parametrize the kernels. We rigorously describe an optimal
collection of 4 smooth scalar invariants on the whole of M(3) x M(3). With
optimal we mean that the collection is independent and universal, meaning that
all invariants are pertinent, and any invariant kernel is a function of them.
We evaluate two collections of invariants, one universal and one not, using the
PONITA neural network architecture. Our experiments show that using a
collection of invariants that is universal positively impacts the accuracy of
PONITA significantly.

mav (minimal angular velocity) distance, defined as the Riemannian length of a
geometrically meaningful curve, as a practical alternative.
  We see an application of the mav distance in geometric deep learning. Namely,
neural networks architectures such as PONITA, relies on geometric invariants to
create their roto-translation equivariant model. The mav distance offers a
trainable invariant, with the parameters that determine the Riemannian metric
acting as learnable weights.
  In this paper we: 1) classify and parametrize all SE(3) invariant metrics on
M(3), 2) describes how to efficiently calculate the mav distance, and 3)
investigate if including the mav distance within PONITA can positively impact
its accuracy in predicting molecular properties.

astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for
inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR)
simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency.
To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using
interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach
for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on
approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these
dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and
competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms
on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in
the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation
tasks.

this day, the most successful unsupervised learning methods revolve around
clustering samples in a mathematical space. In this paper we propose a
primitive-based, unsupervised learning approach for decision-making inspired by
a novel cognition framework. This representation-centric approach models the
input space constructively as a distributed hierarchical structure in an
input-agnostic way. We compared our approach with both current state-of-the-art
unsupervised learning classification, with current state-of-the-art small and
incomplete datasets classification, and with current state-of-the-art cancer
type classification. We show how our proposal outperforms previous
state-of-the-art. We also evaluate some cognition-like properties of our
proposal where it not only outperforms the compared algorithms (even supervised
learning ones), but it also shows a different, more cognition-like, behaviour.

                                        <span>  Deep Learning (DL) in neuroimaging has become increasingly relevant for
detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the
most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which
has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as
Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL
models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,
especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the
other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can
provide important information for learning good representations that can be
transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an
anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical
information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves
state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To
validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the
diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum
disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10
different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings
show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to
more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found

petabytes of data per run, create massive IO and storage challenges for
analysis. Deep learning-based techniques, in particular, make use of these
amounts of domain data to extract patterns that help build scientific
understanding. Here, we demonstrate a streaming workflow in which simulation
data is streamed directly to a machine-learning (ML) framework, circumventing
the file system bottleneck. Data is transformed in transit, asynchronously to
the simulation and the training of the model. With the presented workflow, data
operations can be performed in common and easy-to-use programming languages,
freeing the application user from adapting the application output routines. As
a proof-of-concept we consider a GPU accelerated particle-in-cell (PIConGPU)
simulation of the Kelvin- Helmholtz instability (KHI). We employ experience
replay to avoid catastrophic forgetting in learning from this non-steady
process in a continual manner. We detail challenges addressed while porting and
scaling to Frontier exascale system.

as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current
benchmarks for CQA might not be as complex as we think, as the way they are
built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find
that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be
reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs
to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models decreases
significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced
to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks composed
of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect
the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation,
the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from
current CQA methods.

(VR), yet existing methods often rely on kinematic approach or motion-capture
datasets that omit crucial physical attributes such as contact forces and
finger torques. Consequently, these approaches prioritize tight,
one-size-fits-all grips rather than reflecting users' intended force levels. We
present ForceGrip, a deep learning agent that synthesizes realistic hand
manipulation motions, faithfully reflecting the user's grip force intention.
Instead of mimicking predefined motion datasets, ForceGrip uses generated
training scenarios-randomizing object shapes, wrist movements, and trigger
input flows-to challenge the agent with a broad spectrum of physical
interactions. To effectively learn from these complex tasks, we employ a
three-phase curriculum learning framework comprising Finger Positioning,
Intention Adaptation, and Dynamic Stabilization. This progressive strategy
ensures stable hand-object contact, adaptive force control based on user
inputs, and robust handling under dynamic conditions. Additionally, a proximity
reward function enhances natural finger motions and accelerates training
convergence. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal ForceGrip's
superior force controllability and plausibility compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Demo videos are available as supplementary material and the code is

                                        <span>  Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at
adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a
fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly
ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural
shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target
dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an
irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in
predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant
architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders,
decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard
classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those
seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while
incurring lower computational overhead.

                                        <span>  Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge
the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of
contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical
treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can
quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The
consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared
simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to
the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad
exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a
significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature
for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are
arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the
significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces
two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one
handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript
addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes
some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.

                                        <span>  Transformers have emerged as a powerful neural network architecture capable
of tackling a wide range of learning tasks. In this work, we provide a
theoretical analysis of their ability to automatically extract structure from
data in an unsupervised setting. In particular, we demonstrate their
suitability for clustering when the input data is generated from a Gaussian
mixture model. To this end, we study a simplified two-head attention layer and
define a population risk whose minimization with unlabeled data drives the head
parameters to align with the true mixture centroids. This phenomenon highlights
the ability of attention-based layers to capture underlying distributional
structure. We further examine an attention layer with key, query, and value
matrices fixed to the identity, and show that, even without any trainable
parameters, it can perform in-context quantization, revealing the surprising
capacity of transformer-based methods to adapt dynamically to input-specific
distributions.

                                        <span>  The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great
promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances
in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation,
existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and
therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while
preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM,
a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support
flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs
a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel
Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of
input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous
clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic
and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it
against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset
for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we
perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and
clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world
scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges
such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its
utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis. Project page is at

observation reconstruction often suffer from information conflicts, making it
difficult to learn compact representations and hence result in less robust
policies, especially in the presence of task-irrelevant visual distractions. In
this paper, we first reveal that the information conflicts in current visual
MBRL algorithms stem from visual representation learning and latent dynamics
modeling with an information-theoretic perspective. Based on this finding, we
present a new algorithm to resolve information conflicts for visual MBRL, named
MInCo, which mitigates information conflicts by leveraging negative-free
contrastive learning, aiding in learning invariant representation and robust
policies despite noisy observations. To prevent the dominance of visual
representation learning, we introduce time-varying reweighting to bias the
learning towards dynamics modeling as training proceeds. We evaluate our method
on several robotic control tasks with dynamic background distractions. Our
experiments demonstrate that MInCo learns invariant representations against
background noise and consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art visual
MBRL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/ShiguangSun/minco.

                                        <span>  There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the
Transformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with
Transformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal
(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based
models have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both
sequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate
these two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture
while optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the
Transformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate
dependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into
a variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then
models cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned
embeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling
phases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most
relevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be
seamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,
delivering performance improvements up to 20.7\% over original models. Code is

meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained
significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for
generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features
from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while
the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual
descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant
popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation,
whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the
encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted
features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address
this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to
assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages:
first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on
their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human
evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally,
we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and
beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical
role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating
that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated
descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of
multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in
transformer-based image captioning models.

invested in performing test maintenance - the addition, removal, or
modification of test cases to keep the test suite in sync with the
system-under-test or to otherwise improve its quality. Tool support could
reduce the cost - and improve the quality - of test maintenance by automating
aspects of the process or by providing guidance and support to developers.
  In this study, we explore the capabilities and applications of large language
models (LLMs) - complex machine learning models adapted to textual analysis -
to support test maintenance. We conducted a case study at Ericsson AB where we
explore the triggers that indicate the need for test maintenance, the actions
that LLMs can take, and the considerations that must be made when deploying
LLMs in an industrial setting. We also propose and demonstrate a multi-agent
architecture that can predict which tests require maintenance following a
change to the source code. Collectively, these contributions advance our
theoretical and practical understanding of how LLMs can be deployed to benefit
industrial test maintenance processes.

                                        <span>  Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

                                        <span>  The operating room (OR) is a complex environment where optimizing workflows
is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision
approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify
bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos
for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage
vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to
generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB
videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that
processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation
on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes
shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and
sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection.
Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the
sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing
model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

encrypted protocols, and evolving threats--network traffic analysis has become
critically important. Existing machine learning models often rely only on a
single representation of packets or flows, limiting their ability to capture
the contextual relationships essential for robust analysis. Furthermore,
task-specific architectures for supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised
learning lead to inefficiencies in adapting to varying data formats and
security tasks. To address these gaps, we propose UniNet, a unified framework
that introduces a novel multi-granular traffic representation (T-Matrix),
integrating session, flow, and packet-level features to provide comprehensive
contextual information. Combined with T-Attent, a lightweight attention-based
model, UniNet efficiently learns latent embeddings for diverse security tasks.
Extensive evaluations across four key network security and privacy
problems--anomaly detection, attack classification, IoT device identification,
and encrypted website fingerprinting--demonstrate UniNet's significant
performance gain over state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy,
lower false positive rates, and improved scalability. By addressing the
limitations of single-level models and unifying traffic analysis paradigms,
UniNet sets a new benchmark for modern network security.

from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

software systems, interfacing between the user and the Internet to assist with
tasks that require advanced language understanding. To accomplish these tasks,
the LLM often uses external data sources such as user documents, web retrieval,
results from API calls, etc. This opens up new avenues for attackers to
manipulate the LLM via prompt injection. Adversarial prompts can be injected
into external data sources to override the system's intended instruction and
instead execute a malicious instruction. To mitigate this vulnerability, we
propose a new defense called SecAlign based on the technique of preference
optimization. Our defense first constructs a preference dataset with
prompt-injected inputs, secure outputs (ones that respond to the legitimate
instruction), and insecure outputs (ones that respond to the injection). We
then perform preference optimization on this dataset to teach the LLM to prefer
the secure output over the insecure one. This provides the first known method
that reduces the success rates of various prompt injections to <10%, even
against attacks much more sophisticated than ones seen during training. This
indicates our defense generalizes well against unknown and yet-to-come attacks.
Also, SecAlign models are still practical with similar utility to the one
before defensive training in our evaluations. Our code is at

performance reinforcement learning policy deployment with the Spot RL
Researcher Development Kit for low level motor access on Boston Dynamics Spot.
This represents the first public demonstration of an end to end end
reinforcement learning policy deployed on Spot hardware with training code
publicly available through Nvidia IsaacLab and deployment code available
through Boston Dynamics. We utilize Wasserstein Distance and Maximum Mean
Discrepancy to quantify the distributional dissimilarity of data collected on
hardware and in simulation to measure our sim2real gap. We use these measures
as a scoring function for the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy
to optimize simulated parameters that are unknown or difficult to measure from
Spot. Our procedure for modeling and training produces high quality
reinforcement learning policies capable of multiple gaits, including a flight
phase. We deploy policies capable of over 5.2ms locomotion, more than triple
Spots default controller maximum speed, robustness to slippery surfaces,
disturbance rejection, and overall agility previously unseen on Spot. We detail
our method and release our code to support future work on Spot with the low
level API.

                                        <span>  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

                                        <span>  Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e.,
when data distributions at test time differ from those during training.
Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety
risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression
under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label
relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction
risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of
concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition
between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence
of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results
are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to
solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be
detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally,
our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior
is present also in classification problems.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

                                        <span>  This work introduces Neural CRNs, a general-purpose chemical neural network
framework that embeds learning directly into mass-action chemical reaction
systems. Unlike prior approaches that chemically implement and compose discrete
neural computations, Neural CRNs adopt an analog computing approach, where both
forward and backward passes of learning are implemented as continuous-time
evolutions of molecular concentrations. Such an analog formulation naturally
aligns with the analog nature of chemical kinetics, yielding concise circuits
and practicable reactions. We demonstrate this efficiency by constructing a
streamlined supervised learning procedure executable in just two sequential
stages. We then implement several learning circuits to demonstrate the
framework's linear and nonlinear modeling capabilities and to validate its
learning procedure. These circuits are implemented entirely using unimolecular
and bimolecular reactions, avoiding the complexity of higher-order chemistries.
In summary, Neural CRNs offer a compact, scalable, and autonomous framework for
biochemical learning, opening new avenues for adaptive computing in synthetic
biology, bioengineering, and biomedicine.

                                        <span>  Recent Large-Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods typically operate at the
post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their
pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially
leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel
optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a
probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To
preserve efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM
per se during optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We
achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary
pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from LLM loss,
facilitating efficient optimization via policy gradient estimator without
back-propagation. Thus, our method can 1) support global and heterogeneous
pruning (i.e., automatically determine different redundancy for different
layers), and 2) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our
Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA, LLaMA-2,
LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral models using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets
demonstrate the promising performance of our method in efficiency and
effectiveness. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods infer an agent's reward function
using demonstrations of expert behavior. A Bayesian IRL approach models a
distribution over candidate reward functions, capturing a degree of uncertainty
in the inferred reward function. This is critical in some applications, such as
those involving clinical data. Typically, Bayesian IRL algorithms require large
demonstration datasets, which may not be available in practice. In this work,
we incorporate existing domain-specific data to achieve better posterior
concentration rates. We study a common setting in clinical and biological
applications where we have access to expert demonstrations and known reward
functions for a set of training tasks. Our aim is to learn the reward function
of a new test task given limited expert demonstrations. Existing Bayesian IRL
methods impose restrictions on the form of input data, thus limiting the
incorporation of training task data. To better leverage information from
training tasks, we introduce kernel density Bayesian inverse reinforcement
learning (KD-BIRL). Our approach employs a conditional kernel density
estimator, which uses the known reward functions of the training tasks to
improve the likelihood estimation across a range of reward functions and
demonstration samples. Our empirical results highlight KD-BIRL's faster
concentration rate in comparison to baselines, particularly in low test task
expert demonstration data regimes. Additionally, we are the first to provide
theoretical guarantees of posterior concentration for a Bayesian IRL algorithm.
Taken together, this work introduces a principled and theoretically grounded
framework that enables Bayesian IRL to be applied across a variety of domains.

significantly improve the alignment of human-AI values and further raise the

long-context Chain-of-Thought (long-CoT) tasks. However, existing RLHF (or

easy-to-learn open-source RLHF framework built upon Ray, vLLM, DeepSpeed, and
HuggingFace Transformers, featuring a simplified design, clear code structure,
and comprehensive documentation to facilitate entry for researchers and
practitioners. Experimental results show that OpenRLHF achieves superior
training efficiency with speedups ranging from 1.22x to 1.68x across different
model sizes compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while requiring
significantly fewer lines of code for implementation. OpenRLHF is publicly
available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF, and has already been adopted
by leading institutions to accelerate RLHF research and learning.

                                        <span>  Machine learning models are prone to capturing the spurious correlations
between non-causal attributes and classes, with counterfactual data
augmentation being a promising direction for breaking these spurious
associations. However, generating counterfactual data explicitly poses a
challenge, and incorporating augmented data into the training process decreases
training efficiency. This study proposes an Implicit Counterfactual Data
Augmentation (ICDA) method to remove spurious correlations and make stable
predictions. Specifically, first, a novel sample-wise augmentation strategy is
developed that generates semantically and counterfactually meaningful deep
features with distinct augmentation strength for each sample. Second, we derive
an easy-to-compute surrogate loss on the augmented feature set when the number
of augmented samples becomes infinite. Third, two concrete schemes are
proposed, including direct quantification and meta-learning, to derive the key
parameters for the robust loss. In addition, ICDA is explained from a
regularization perspective, revealing its capacity to improve intra-class
compactness and augment margins at both class and sample levels. Extensive
experiments have been conducted across various biased learning scenarios
covering both image and text datasets, demonstrating that ICDA consistently
enhances the generalization and robustness performance of popular networks.

                                        <span>  The rising influence of social media platforms in various domains, including
tourism, has highlighted the growing need for efficient and automated Natural
Language Processing (NLP) strategies to take advantage of this valuable
resource. However, the transformation of multilingual, unstructured, and
informal texts into structured knowledge still poses significant challenges,
most notably the never-ending requirement for manually annotated data to train
deep learning classifiers. In this work, we study different NLP techniques to
establish the best ones to obtain competitive performances while keeping the
need for training annotated data to a minimum. To do so, we built the first
publicly available multilingual dataset (French, English, and Spanish) for the
tourism domain, composed of tourism-related tweets. The dataset includes
multilayered, manually revised annotations for Named Entity Recognition (NER)
for Locations and Fine-grained Thematic Concepts Extraction mapped to the
Thesaurus of Tourism and Leisure Activities of the World Tourism Organization,
as well as for Sentiment Analysis at the tweet level. Extensive experimentation
comparing various few-shot and fine-tuning techniques with modern language
models demonstrate that modern few-shot techniques allow us to obtain
competitive results for all three tasks with very little annotation data: 5
tweets per label (15 in total) for Sentiment Analysis, 30 tweets for Named
Entity Recognition of Locations and 1K tweets annotated with fine-grained
thematic concepts, a highly fine-grained sequence labeling task based on an
inventory of 315 classes. We believe that our results, grounded in a novel
dataset, pave the way for applying NLP to new domain-specific applications,
reducing the need for manual annotations and circumventing the complexities of
rule-based, ad-hoc solutions.

real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains
challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has
benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be
notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has
succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still
largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing
MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into
traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase
our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on
multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation
video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without
any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world
pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of
generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the
multimodal sim-to-real gap.

collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

                                        <span>  We propose LiteReality, a novel pipeline that converts RGB-D scans of indoor
environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

                                        <span>  Effectively handling temporal redundancy remains a key challenge in learning
video models. Prevailing approaches often treat each set of frames
independently, failing to effectively capture the temporal dependencies and
redundancies inherent in videos. To address this limitation, we introduce
RefTok, a novel reference-based tokenization method capable of capturing
complex temporal dynamics and contextual information. Our method encodes and
decodes sets of frames conditioned on an unquantized reference frame. When
decoded, RefTok preserves the continuity of motion and the appearance of
objects across frames. For example, RefTok retains facial details despite head
motion, reconstructs text correctly, preserves small patterns, and maintains
the legibility of handwriting from the context. Across 4 video datasets (K600,
UCF-101, BAIR Robot Pushing, and DAVIS), RefTok significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art tokenizers (Cosmos and MAGVIT) and improves all
evaluated metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) by an average of 36.7% at the same or
higher compression ratios. When a video generation model is trained using
RefTok's latents on the BAIR Robot Pushing task, the generations not only
outperform MAGVIT-B but the larger MAGVIT-L, which has 4x more parameters,
across all generation metrics by an average of 27.9%.

                                        <span>  Video generation models have demonstrated remarkable performance, yet their
broader adoption remains constrained by slow inference speeds and substantial
computational costs, primarily due to the iterative nature of the denoising
process. Addressing this bottleneck is essential for democratizing advanced
video synthesis technologies and enabling their integration into real-world
applications. This work proposes EasyCache, a training-free acceleration
framework for video diffusion models. EasyCache introduces a lightweight,
runtime-adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically reuses previously computed
transformation vectors, avoiding redundant computations during inference.
Unlike prior approaches, EasyCache requires no offline profiling,
pre-computation, or extensive parameter tuning. We conduct comprehensive
studies on various large-scale video generation models, including OpenSora,
Wan2.1, and HunyuanVideo. Our method achieves leading acceleration performance,
reducing inference time by up to 2.1-3.3$\times$ compared to the original
baselines while maintaining high visual fidelity with a significant up to 36%
PSNR improvement compared to the previous SOTA method. This improvement makes
our EasyCache a efficient and highly accessible solution for high-quality video
generation in both research and practical applications. The code is available

                                        <span>  Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in interpreting images using natural language. However, without
using large-scale datasets for retraining, these models are difficult to adapt
to specialized vision tasks, e.g., chart understanding. This problem is caused
by a mismatch between pre-training and downstream datasets: pre-training
datasets primarily concentrate on scenes and objects but contain limited
information about specialized, non-object images, such as charts and tables. In
this paper, we share an interesting finding that training an MLLM with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning data can facilitate model adaptation in
specialized vision tasks, especially under data-limited regimes. However, we
identify a critical issue within CoT data distilled from pre-trained MLLMs,
i.e., the data often contains multiple factual errors in the reasoning steps.
To address the problem, we propose Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT), a simple
bootstrapping-based approach that aims to inject grounding information (i.e.,
bounding boxes) into CoT data, essentially making the reasoning steps more
faithful to input images. We evaluate our approach on five specialized vision
tasks, which cover a variety of visual formats including charts, tables,
receipts, and reports. The results demonstrate that under data-limited regimes
our approach significantly improves upon fine-tuning and distillation.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in video generation, particularly in diffusion models,
have driven notable progress in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
synthesis. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating dynamic motion
signals and flexible spatial constraints. Existing T2V methods typically rely
on text prompts, which inherently lack precise control over the spatial layout
of generated content. In contrast, I2V methods are limited by their dependence
on real images, which restricts the editability of the synthesized content.
Although some methods incorporate ControlNet to introduce image-based
conditioning, they often lack explicit motion control and require
computationally expensive training. To address these limitations, we propose
AnyI2V, a training-free framework that animates any conditional images with
user-defined motion trajectories. AnyI2V supports a broader range of modalities
as the conditional image, including data types such as meshes and point clouds
that are not supported by ControlNet, enabling more flexible and versatile
video generation. Additionally, it supports mixed conditional inputs and
enables style transfer and editing via LoRA and text prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed AnyI2V achieves superior performance
and provides a new perspective in spatial- and motion-controlled video
generation. Code is available at https://henghuiding.com/AnyI2V/.

                                        <span>  With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world
applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual
modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world
environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from
target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.
However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger
for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding
in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric
jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in
constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this
setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates
contextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically
generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric
jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic
toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt
that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.
Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success
Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming
the baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%. The

                                        <span>  The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

enables intelligent systems to perceive and interact with their environment.
However, multimodal HAR systems still encounter key challenges, such as
difficulties in cross-modal feature alignment and imbalanced modality
contributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
Dynamic Contrastive Dual-Path Network (DCDP-HAR). The framework comprises three
key components. First, a dual-path feature extraction architecture is employed,
where ResNet and DenseNet branches collaboratively process multimodal sensor
data. Second, a multi-stage contrastive learning mechanism is introduced to
achieve progressive alignment from local perception to semantic abstraction.
Third, we present a confidence-driven gradient modulation strategy that
dynamically monitors and adjusts the learning intensity of each modality branch
during backpropagation, effectively alleviating modality competition. In
addition, a momentum-based gradient accumulation strategy is adopted to enhance
training stability. We conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness
of each component and perform extensive comparative experiments on four public
benchmark datasets.

                                        <span>  Recovering 3D structures with open-vocabulary scene understanding from 2D
images is a fundamental but daunting task. Recent developments have achieved
this by performing per-scene optimization with embedded language information.
However, they heavily rely on the calibrated dense-view reconstruction
paradigm, thereby suffering from severe rendering artifacts and implausible
semantic synthesis when limited views are available. In this paper, we
introduce a novel generative framework, coined LangScene-X, to unify and
generate 3D consistent multi-modality information for reconstruction and
understanding. Powered by the generative capability of creating more consistent
novel observations, we can build generalizable 3D language-embedded scenes from
only sparse views. Specifically, we first train a TriMap video diffusion model
that can generate appearance (RGBs), geometry (normals), and semantics
(segmentation maps) from sparse inputs through progressive knowledge
integration. Furthermore, we propose a Language Quantized Compressor (LQC),
trained on large-scale image datasets, to efficiently encode language
embeddings, enabling cross-scene generalization without per-scene retraining.
Finally, we reconstruct the language surface fields by aligning language
information onto the surface of 3D scenes, enabling open-ended language
queries. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate the superiority
of our LangScene-X over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and
generalizability. Project Page: https://liuff19.github.io/LangScene-X.

                                        <span>  We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for
high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from
videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and
virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static
faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny
valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face
through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static
faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations,
complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on
predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D
Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights
lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate
Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases
expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However,
splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires
inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by
reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'.
This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly
integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians
into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our
evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians
outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency
details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular
reflections.

constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The
Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a
promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires
manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to
process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates
the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small
set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors,
as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a
reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic
generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and
instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1)
memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware
feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation

generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these
models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for
fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have
emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches.
However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and
visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly
from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a
core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to
account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation
during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature
injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising
process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the
model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure
preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful
structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and
a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual
quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both
structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot
conditioning scenarios.

                                        <span>  The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video
platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques
that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing
automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR
transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual
context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a
human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages
multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach
incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative
summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic
understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply
scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks:
highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant
content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel
benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500
professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate
that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both
general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the
quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

                                        <span>  In the aftermath of earthquakes, social media images have become a crucial
resource for disaster reconnaissance, providing immediate insights into the
extent of damage. Traditional approaches to damage severity assessment in
post-earthquake social media images often rely on classification methods, which
are inherently subjective and incapable of accounting for the varying extents
of damage within an image. Addressing these limitations, this study proposes a
novel approach by framing damage severity assessment as a semantic segmentation
problem, aiming for a more objective analysis of damage in earthquake-affected
areas. The methodology involves the construction of a segmented damage severity
dataset, categorizing damage into three degrees: undamaged structures, damaged
structures, and debris. Utilizing this dataset, the study fine-tunes a
SegFormer model to generate damage severity segmentations for post-earthquake
social media images. Furthermore, a new damage severity scoring system is
introduced, quantifying damage by considering the varying degrees of damage
across different areas within images, adjusted for depth estimation. The
application of this approach allows for the quantification of damage severity
in social media images in a more objective and comprehensive manner. By
providing a nuanced understanding of damage, this study enhances the ability to
offer precise guidance to disaster reconnaissance teams, facilitating more
effective and targeted response efforts in the aftermath of earthquakes.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

                                        <span>  The growing demand for oriented object detection (OOD) across various domains
has driven significant research in this area. However, the high cost of dataset
annotation remains a major concern. Current mainstream OOD algorithms can be
mainly categorized into three types: (1) fully supervised methods using
complete oriented bounding box (OBB) annotations, (2) semi-supervised methods
using partial OBB annotations, and (3) weakly supervised methods using weak
annotations such as horizontal boxes or points. However, these algorithms
inevitably increase the cost of models in terms of annotation speed or
annotation cost. To address this issue, we propose:(1) the first Partial
Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection (PWOOD) framework based on
partially weak annotations (horizontal boxes or single points), which can
efficiently leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, significantly
outperforming weakly supervised algorithms trained with partially weak
annotations, also offers a lower cost solution; (2) Orientation-and-Scale-aware
Student (OS-Student) model capable of learning orientation and scale
information with only a small amount of orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic
weak annotations; and (3) Class-Agnostic Pseudo-Label Filtering strategy (CPF)
to reduce the model's sensitivity to static filtering thresholds. Comprehensive
experiments on DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0 and DIOR datasets demonstrate that our PWOOD
framework performs comparably to, or even surpasses, traditional
semi-supervised algorithms.

from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

to train a VLM and flow-matching-based pose head capable of producing
instruction-aligned grasp poses for tabletop objects. To assess DexVLG's
performance, we create benchmarks in physics-based simulations and conduct
real-world experiments. Extensive testing demonstrates DexVLG's strong

                                        <span>  Pixel-wise annotations are notoriously labourious and costly to obtain in the
medical domain. To mitigate this burden, weakly supervised approaches based on
bounding box annotations-much easier to acquire-offer a practical alternative.
Vision foundation models have recently shown noteworthy segmentation
performance when provided with prompts such as points or bounding boxes. Prompt
learning exploits these models by adapting them to downstream tasks and
automating segmentation, thereby reducing user intervention. However, existing
prompt learning approaches depend on fully annotated segmentation masks. This
paper proposes a novel framework that combines the representational power of
foundation models with the annotation efficiency of weakly supervised
segmentation. More specifically, our approach automates prompt generation for
foundation models using only bounding box annotations. Our proposed
optimization scheme integrates multiple constraints derived from box
annotations with pseudo-labels generated by the prompted foundation model.
Extensive experiments across multimodal datasets reveal that our weakly
supervised method achieves an average Dice score of 84.90% in a limited data
setting, outperforming existing fully-supervised and weakly-supervised
approaches. The code is available at

large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

keypoint-guided Text-to-Image diffusion models, existing mainstream
keypoint-guided models encounter challenges in controlling the generation of
more general non-rigid objects beyond humans (e.g., animals). Moreover, it is
difficult to generate multiple overlapping humans and animals based on keypoint
controls solely. These challenges arise from two main aspects: the inherent
limitations of existing controllable methods and the lack of suitable datasets.
First, we design a DiT-based framework, named UniMC, to explore unifying
controllable multi-class image generation. UniMC integrates instance- and
keypoint-level conditions into compact tokens, incorporating attributes such as
class, bounding box, and keypoint coordinates. This approach overcomes the
limitations of previous methods that struggled to distinguish instances and
classes due to their reliance on skeleton images as conditions. Second, we
propose HAIG-2.9M, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset designed
for keypoint-guided human and animal image generation. HAIG-2.9M includes 786K
images with 2.9M instances. This dataset features extensive annotations such as
keypoints, bounding boxes, and fine-grained captions for both humans and
animals, along with rigorous manual inspection to ensure annotation accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the high quality of HAIG-2.9M and the
effectiveness of UniMC, particularly in heavy occlusions and multi-class
scenarios.

developing end-to-end embodied intelligent systems. To achieve this, recent
approaches resort to 2D-to-3D feature alignment paradigm, which leads to
limited 3D understanding capability and potential semantic information loss. In
light of this, we propose SIU3R, the first alignment-free framework for
generalizable simultaneous understanding and 3D reconstruction from unposed

pixel-aligned 3D representation, and unifies multiple understanding tasks into
a set of unified learnable queries, enabling native 3D understanding without
the need of alignment with 2D models. To encourage collaboration between the
two tasks with shared representation, we further conduct in-depth analyses of
their mutual benefits, and propose two lightweight modules to facilitate their
interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance not only on the individual tasks of 3D
reconstruction and understanding, but also on the task of simultaneous
understanding and 3D reconstruction, highlighting the advantages of our
alignment-free framework and the effectiveness of the mutual benefit designs.

transferring the source identity to the target video and accurately preserving
the dynamic attributes of the target face, such as head poses, facial
expressions, lip-sync, \etc. Existing methods mainly focus on achieving
high-quality identity transfer but often fall short in maintaining the dynamic
attributes of the target face, leading to inconsistent results. We attribute
this issue to the inherent coupling of facial appearance and motion in videos.
To address this, we propose CanonSwap, a novel video face-swapping framework
that decouples motion information from appearance information. Specifically,
CanonSwap first eliminates motion-related information, enabling identity
modification within a unified canonical space. Subsequently, the swapped
feature is reintegrated into the original video space, ensuring the
preservation of the target face's dynamic attributes. To further achieve
precise identity transfer with minimal artifacts and enhanced realism, we
design a Partial Identity Modulation module that adaptively integrates source
identity features using a spatial mask to restrict modifications to facial
regions. Additionally, we introduce several fine-grained synchronization
metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of video face swapping
methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality, temporal
consistency, and identity preservation. Our project page are publicly available

challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

                                        <span>  Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as powerful image priors in Bayesian
computational imaging. Two primary strategies have been proposed for leveraging
DMs in this context: Plug-and-Play methods, which are zero-shot and highly
flexible but rely on approximations; and specialized conditional DMs, which
achieve higher accuracy and faster inference for specific tasks through
supervised training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that
integrates deep unfolding and model distillation to transform a DM image prior
into a few-step conditional model for posterior sampling. A central innovation
of our approach is the unfolding of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
- specifically, the recently proposed LATINO Langevin sampler (Spagnoletti et
al., 2025) - representing the first known instance of deep unfolding applied to
a Monte Carlo sampling scheme. We demonstrate our proposed unfolded and
distilled samplers through extensive experiments and comparisons with the state
of the art, where they achieve excellent accuracy and computational efficiency,
while retaining the flexibility to adapt to variations in the forward model at
inference time.

                                        <span>  Image-based lighting is a widely used technique to reproduce shading under
real-world lighting conditions, especially in real-time rendering applications.
A particularly challenging scenario involves materials exhibiting a sparkling
or glittering appearance, caused by discrete microfacets scattered across their
surface. In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation for image-based
lighting of glints, enabling fully dynamic material properties and environment
maps. Our novel approach is grounded in real-time glint rendering under area
light illumination and employs standard environment map filtering techniques.
Crucially, our environment map filtering process is sufficiently fast to be
executed on a per-frame basis. Our method assumes that the environment map is
partitioned into few homogeneous regions of constant radiance. By filtering the
corresponding indicator functions with the normal distribution function, we
obtain the probabilities for individual microfacets to reflect light from each
region. During shading, these probabilities are utilized to hierarchically
sample a multinomial distribution, facilitated by our novel dual-gated Gaussian
approximation of binomial distributions. We validate that our real-time
approximation is close to ground-truth renderings for a range of material
properties and lighting conditions, and demonstrate robust and stable
performance, with little overhead over rendering glints from a single
directional light. Compared to rendering smooth materials without glints, our
approach requires twice as much memory to store the prefiltered environment
map.

and sizes. In this paper, we introduce MISCGrasp, a volumetric grasping method
that integrates multi-scale feature extraction with contrastive feature
enhancement for self-adaptive grasping. We propose a query-based interaction
between high-level and low-level features through the Insight Transformer,
while the Empower Transformer selectively attends to the highest-level
features, which synergistically strikes a balance between focusing on fine
geometric details and overall geometric structures. Furthermore, MISCGrasp
utilizes multi-scale contrastive learning to exploit similarities among
positive grasp samples, ensuring consistency across multi-scale features.
Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate
that MISCGrasp outperforms baseline and variant methods in tabletop
decluttering tasks. More details are available at https://miscgrasp.github.io/.

diverse datasets. Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized training but
suffers from high communication costs and is often restricted to a single
downstream task, reducing flexibility. We propose a data-sharing method via
Differentially Private (DP) generative models. By adopting foundation models,
we extract compact, informative embeddings, reducing redundancy and lowering
computational overhead. Clients collaboratively train a Differentially Private
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (DP-CVAE) to model a global, privacy-aware
data distribution, supporting diverse downstream tasks. Our approach, validated
across multiple feature extractors, enhances privacy, scalability, and
efficiency, outperforming traditional FL classifiers while ensuring
differential privacy. Additionally, DP-CVAE produces higher-fidelity embeddings
than DP-CGAN while requiring $5{\times}$ fewer parameters.

the misuse of highly realistic AI-generated images (AIGI) in spreading
misinformation, posing a threat to public information security. Although
existing AIGI detection techniques are generally effective, they face two
issues: 1) a lack of human-verifiable explanations, and 2) a lack of
generalization in the latest generation technology. To address these issues, we
introduce a large-scale and comprehensive dataset, Holmes-Set, which includes
the Holmes-SFTSet, an instruction-tuning dataset with explanations on whether
images are AI-generated, and the Holmes-DPOSet, a human-aligned preference
dataset. Our work introduces an efficient data annotation method called the
Multi-Expert Jury, enhancing data generation through structured MLLM
explanations and quality control via cross-model evaluation, expert defect
filtering, and human preference modification. In addition, we propose Holmes
Pipeline, a meticulously designed three-stage training framework comprising
visual expert pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference
optimization. Holmes Pipeline adapts multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
for AIGI detection while generating human-verifiable and human-aligned
explanations, ultimately yielding our model AIGI-Holmes. During the inference
stage, we introduce a collaborative decoding strategy that integrates the model
perception of the visual expert with the semantic reasoning of MLLMs, further
enhancing the generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on three
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our AIGI-Holmes.

                                        <span>  Deepfake detection models face two critical challenges: generalization to
unseen manipulations and demographic fairness among population groups. However,
existing approaches often demonstrate that these two objectives are inherently
conflicting, revealing a trade-off between them. In this paper, we, for the
first time, uncover and formally define a causal relationship between fairness
and generalization. Building on the back-door adjustment, we show that
controlling for confounders (data distribution and model capacity) enables
improved generalization via fairness interventions. Motivated by this insight,
we propose Demographic Attribute-insensitive Intervention Detection (DAID), a
plug-and-play framework composed of: i) Demographic-aware data rebalancing,
which employs inverse-propensity weighting and subgroup-wise feature
normalization to neutralize distributional biases; and ii) Demographic-agnostic
feature aggregation, which uses a novel alignment loss to suppress
sensitive-attribute signals. Across three cross-domain benchmarks, DAID
consistently achieves superior performance in both fairness and generalization
compared to several state-of-the-art detectors, validating both its theoretical
foundation and practical effectiveness.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we propose a novel model called Learnable VAE (L-VAE), which
learns a disentangled representation together with the hyperparameters of the
cost function. L-VAE can be considered as an extension of \b{eta}-VAE, wherein
the hyperparameter, \b{eta}, is empirically adjusted. L-VAE mitigates the
limitations of \b{eta}-VAE by learning the relative weights of the terms in the
loss function to control the dynamic trade-off between disentanglement and
reconstruction losses. In the proposed model, the weight of the loss terms and
the parameters of the model architecture are learned concurrently. An
additional regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent bias
towards either reconstruction or disentanglement losses. Experimental analyses
show that the proposed L-VAE finds an effective balance between reconstruction
fidelity and disentangling the latent dimensions. Comparisons of the proposed
L-VAE against \b{eta}-VAE, VAE, ControlVAE, DynamicVAE, and {\sigma}-VAE on
datasets, such as dSprites, MPI3D-complex, Falcor3D, and Isaac3D reveals that
L-VAE consistently provides the best or the second best performances measured
by a set of disentanglement metrics. Moreover, qualitative experiments on
CelebA dataset, confirm the success of the L-VAE model for disentangling the
facial attributes.

                                        <span>  The increasing importance of Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) algorithms in
space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

                                        <span>  The challenge of long video understanding lies in its high computational
complexity and prohibitive memory cost, since the memory and computation
required by transformer-based LLMs scale quadratically with input sequence
length. We propose AuroraLong to address this challenge by replacing the LLM
component in MLLMs with a linear RNN language model that handles input sequence
of arbitrary length with constant-size hidden states. To further increase
throughput and efficiency, we combine visual token merge with linear RNN models
by reordering the visual tokens by their sizes in ascending order. Despite
having only 2B parameters and being trained exclusively on public data,
AuroraLong achieves performance comparable to Transformer-based models of
similar size trained on private datasets across multiple video benchmarks. This
demonstrates the potential of efficient, linear RNNs to democratize long video
understanding by lowering its computational entry barrier. To our best
knowledge, we are the first to use a linear RNN based LLM backbone in a
LLaVA-like model for open-ended video understanding.

medical analysis. Effectively supporting broader applications requires
considering anatomical structure variations in location, scale, and morphology,
which are crucial for capturing meaningful distinctions. However, previous mSSL
methods partition images with fixed-size patches, often ignoring the structure
variations. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on 3D medical images
with the goal of learning structure-aware representations. We assume that
patches within the same structure share the same semantics (semantic
consistency) while those from different structures exhibit distinct semantics
(semantic discrepancy). Based on this assumption, we propose an mSSL framework
named $S^2DC$, achieving Structure-aware Semantic Discrepancy and Consistency
in two steps. First, $S^2DC$ enforces distinct representations for different
patches to increase semantic discrepancy by leveraging an optimal transport
strategy. Second, $S^2DC$ advances semantic consistency at the structural level
based on neighborhood similarity distribution. By bridging patch-level and
structure-level representations, $S^2DC$ achieves structure-aware
representations. Thoroughly evaluated across 10 datasets, 4 tasks, and 3
modalities, our proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods in mSSL.

                                        <span>  Vessels are complex structures in the body that have been studied extensively
in multiple representations. While voxelization is the most common of them,
meshes and parametric models are critical in various applications due to their
desirable properties. However, these representations are typically extracted
through segmentations and used disjointly from each other. We propose a
framework that joins the three representations under differentiable
transformations. By leveraging differentiable voxelization, we automatically
extract a parametric shape model of the vessels through shape-to-segmentation
fitting, where we learn shape parameters from segmentations without the
explicit need for ground-truth shape parameters. The vessel is parametrized as
centerlines and radii using cubic B-splines, ensuring smoothness and continuity
by construction. Meshes are differentiably extracted from the learned shape
parameters, resulting in high-fidelity meshes that can be manipulated post-fit.
Our method can accurately capture the geometry of complex vessels, as
demonstrated by the volumetric fits in experiments on aortas, aneurysms, and
brain vessels.

                                        <span>  Due to visual ambiguities and inter-person occlusions, existing human pose
estimation methods cannot recover plausible close interactions from in-the-wild
videos. Even state-of-the-art large foundation models~(\eg, SAM) cannot
accurately distinguish human semantics in such challenging scenarios. In this
work, we find that human appearance can provide a straightforward cue to
address these obstacles. Based on this observation, we propose a dual-branch
optimization framework to reconstruct accurate interactive motions with
plausible body contacts constrained by human appearances, social proxemics, and
physical laws. Specifically, we first train a diffusion model to learn the
human proxemic behavior and pose prior knowledge. The trained network and two
optimizable tensors are then incorporated into a dual-branch optimization
framework to reconstruct human motions and appearances. Several constraints
based on 3D Gaussians, 2D keypoints, and mesh penetrations are also designed to
assist the optimization. With the proxemics prior and diverse constraints, our
method is capable of estimating accurate interactions from in-the-wild videos
captured in complex environments. We further build a dataset with pseudo
ground-truth interaction annotations, which may promote future research on pose
estimation and human behavior understanding. Experimental results on several
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. The

recovers a metric scale 3D point map of a scene from a single image. Our method
builds upon the recent monocular geometry estimation approach, MoGe, which
predicts affine-invariant point maps with unknown scales. We explore effective
strategies to extend MoGe for metric geometry prediction without compromising
the relative geometry accuracy provided by the affine-invariant point
representation. Additionally, we discover that noise and errors in real data
diminish fine-grained detail in the predicted geometry. We address this by
developing a unified data refinement approach that filters and completes real
data from different sources using sharp synthetic labels, significantly
enhancing the granularity of the reconstructed geometry while maintaining the
overall accuracy. We train our model on a large corpus of mixed datasets and
conducted comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its superior performance in
achieving accurate relative geometry, precise metric scale, and fine-grained
detail recovery -- capabilities that no previous methods have simultaneously
achieved.

morphological analysis of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei}, aimed at optimizing
genetic selection tasks in aquaculture. Existing deep learning and computer
vision techniques were modified to address the specific challenges of shrimp
morphology analysis from RGBD images. IMASHRIMP incorporates two discrimination
modules, based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, to classify images by the
point of view and determine rostrum integrity. It is proposed a "two-factor
authentication (human and IA)" system, it reduces human error in view
classification from 0.97% to 0% and in rostrum detection from 12.46% to 3.64%.
Additionally, a pose estimation module was adapted from VitPose to predict 23
key points on the shrimp's skeleton, with separate networks for lateral and
dorsal views. A morphological regression module, using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM) model, was integrated to convert pixel measurements to centimeter units.
Experimental results show that the system effectively reduces human error,
achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.94% for pose estimation and a
pixel-to-centimeter conversion error of 0.07 (+/- 0.1) cm. IMASHRIMP
demonstrates the potential to automate and accelerate shrimp morphological
analysis, enhancing the efficiency of genetic selection and contributing to
more sustainable aquaculture practices.The code are available at

                                        <span>  India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

most common sensor in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance
systems is the RGB camera. A challenge in RGB pedestrian detection, that does
not appear to have large public datasets, is low-light conditions. As a
solution, in this research, we propose an automated infrared-RGB labeling
pipeline. The proposed pipeline consists of 1) Infrared detection, where a
fine-tuned model for infrared pedestrian detection is used 2) Label transfer
process from the infrared detections to their RGB counterparts 3) Training
object detection models using the generated labels for low-light RGB pedestrian
detection. The research was performed using the KAIST dataset. For the
evaluation, object detection models were trained on the generated autolabels
and ground truth labels. When compared on a previously unseen image sequence,
the results showed that the models trained on generated labels outperformed the
ones trained on ground-truth labels in 6 out of 9 cases for the mAP@50 and
mAP@50-95 metrics. The source code for this research is available at

                                        <span>  Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are widely used to encode data as
continuous functions, enabling the visualization of large-scale multivariate
scientific simulation data with reduced memory usage. However, existing
INR-based methods face three main limitations: (1) inflexible representation of
complex structures, (2) primarily focusing on single-variable data, and (3)
dependence on structured grids. Thus, their performance degrades when applied
to complex real-world datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel neural network-based framework, MC-INR, which handles multivariate data
on unstructured grids. It combines meta-learning and clustering to enable
flexible encoding of complex structures. To further improve performance, we
introduce a residual-based dynamic re-clustering mechanism that adaptively
partitions clusters based on local error. We also propose a branched layer to
leverage multivariate data through independent branches simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that MC-INR outperforms existing methods on
scientific data encoding tasks.

                                        <span>  Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis,
enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities.
Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various
medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary
challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored,
limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full
attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational
costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to
suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an
efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a
pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image
recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks
such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates
hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of
feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces
a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to
improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining
high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is
explicitly designed to attend to the most relevant content. In addition, a
detailed theoretical analysis has been conducted, demonstrating that MedFormer
has superior generality and efficiency in comparison to existing medical vision
transformers. Extensive experiments on a variety of imaging modality datasets
consistently show that MedFormer is highly effective in enhancing performance
across all three above-mentioned medical image recognition tasks. The code is

                                        <span>  Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

polygon meshes with superior geometric properties, including manifold topology,
watertight detection, and consistent face normals, which are critical for
practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, showcasing not only intricate mesh generation but also
significantly improved geometric integrity.

                                        <span>  Different from general object detection, moving infrared small target
detection faces huge challenges due to tiny target size and weak background
contrast.Currently, most existing methods are fully-supervised, heavily relying
on a large number of manual target-wise annotations. However, manually
annotating video sequences is often expensive and time-consuming, especially
for low-quality infrared frame images. Inspired by general object detection,
non-fully supervised strategies ($e.g.$, weakly supervised) are believed to be
potential in reducing annotation requirements. To break through traditional
fully-supervised frameworks, as the first exploration work, this paper proposes
a new weakly-supervised contrastive learning (WeCoL) scheme, only requires
simple target quantity prompts during model training.Specifically, in our
scheme, based on the pretrained segment anything model (SAM), a potential
target mining strategy is designed to integrate target activation maps and
multi-frame energy accumulation.Besides, contrastive learning is adopted to
further improve the reliability of pseudo-labels, by calculating the similarity
between positive and negative samples in feature subspace.Moreover, we propose
a long-short term motion-aware learning scheme to simultaneously model the
local motion patterns and global motion trajectory of small targets.The
extensive experiments on two public datasets (DAUB and ITSDT-15K) verify that
our weakly-supervised scheme could often outperform early fully-supervised
methods. Even, its performance could reach over 90\% of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
fully-supervised ones.

supervised learning with paired underexposed and well-illuminated images.
However, collecting such datasets is often impractical in real-world scenarios.
Moreover, these methods can lead to over-enhancement, distorting
well-illuminated regions. To address these issues, we propose IGDNet, a
Zero-Shot enhancement method that operates solely on a single test image,
without requiring guiding priors or training data. IGDNet exhibits strong
generalization ability and effectively suppresses noise while restoring
illumination. The framework comprises a decomposition module and a denoising
module. The former separates the image into illumination and reflection
components via a dense connection network, while the latter enhances
non-uniformly illuminated regions using an illumination-guided pixel adaptive
correction method. A noise pair is generated through downsampling and refined
iteratively to produce the final result. Extensive experiments on four public
datasets demonstrate that IGDNet significantly improves visual quality under
complex lighting conditions. Quantitative results on metrics like PSNR
(20.41dB) and SSIM (0.860dB) show that it outperforms 14 state-of-the-art
unsupervised methods. The code will be released soon.

executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

                                        <span>  Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising solution for adapting a
source model to unseen medical sites using unlabeled test data, due to the high
cost of data annotation. Existing TTA methods consider scenarios where data
from one or multiple domains arrives in complete domain units. However, in
clinical practice, data usually arrives in domain fragments of arbitrary
lengths and in random arrival orders, due to resource constraints and patient
variability. This paper investigates a practical Free-Form Test-Time Adaptation
(F$^{2}$TTA) task, where a source model is adapted to such free-form domain
fragments, with shifts occurring between fragments unpredictably. In this
setting, these shifts could distort the adaptation process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Image-level Disentangled Prompt Tuning (I-DiPT)
framework. I-DiPT employs an image-invariant prompt to explore domain-invariant
representations for mitigating the unpredictable shifts, and an image-specific
prompt to adapt the source model to each test image from the incoming
fragments. The prompts may suffer from insufficient knowledge representation
since only one image is available for training. To overcome this limitation, we
first introduce Uncertainty-oriented Masking (UoM), which encourages the
prompts to extract sufficient information from the incoming image via masked
consistency learning driven by the uncertainty of the source model
representations. Then, we further propose a Parallel Graph Distillation (PGD)
method that reuses knowledge from historical image-specific and image-invariant
prompts through parallel graph networks. Experiments on breast cancer and
glaucoma classification demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing
TTA approaches in F$^{2}$TTA. Code is available at

personalized customization to enhance their visual appeal, yet this area
remains insufficiently explored. Although current 3D Gaussian editing methods
can be adapted for facial makeup purposes, these methods fail to meet the
fundamental requirements for achieving realistic makeup effects: 1) ensuring a
consistent appearance during drivable expressions, 2) preserving the identity
throughout the makeup process, and 3) enabling precise control over fine
details. To address these, we propose a specialized 3D makeup method named
AvatarMakeup, leveraging a pretrained diffusion model to transfer makeup
patterns from a single reference photo of any individual. We adopt a
coarse-to-fine idea to first maintain the consistent appearance and identity,
and then to refine the details. In particular, the diffusion model is employed
to generate makeup images as supervision. Due to the uncertainties in diffusion
process, the generated images are inconsistent across different viewpoints and
expressions. Therefore, we propose a Coherent Duplication method to coarsely
apply makeup to the target while ensuring consistency across dynamic and
multiview effects. Coherent Duplication optimizes a global UV map by recoding
the averaged facial attributes among the generated makeup images. By querying
the global UV map, it easily synthesizes coherent makeup guidance from
arbitrary views and expressions to optimize the target avatar. Given the coarse
makeup avatar, we further enhance the makeup by incorporating a Refinement
Module into the diffusion model to achieve high makeup quality. Experiments
demonstrate that AvatarMakeup achieves state-of-the-art makeup transfer quality
and consistency throughout animation.

in preventing potential structural failures that could endanger lives. Manual
detection by inexperienced personnel can be slow, inconsistent, and prone to
human error, which may compromise the reliability of assessments. The current
study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel deep-learning
architecture designed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of structural
crack detection. In this research, various configurations of residual U-Net
models were utilized. These models, due to their robustness in capturing fine
details, were further integrated into an ensemble with a meta-model comprising
convolutional blocks. This unique combination aimed to boost prediction
efficiency beyond what individual models could achieve. The ensemble's
performance was evaluated against well-established architectures such as SegNet
and the traditional U-Net. Results demonstrated that the residual U-Net models
outperformed their predecessors, particularly with low-resolution imagery, and
the ensemble model exceeded the performance of individual models, proving it as
the most effective. The assessment was based on the Intersection over Union
(IoU) metric and DICE coefficient. The ensemble model achieved the highest
scores, signifying superior accuracy. This advancement suggests way for more
reliable automated systems in structural defects monitoring tasks.

significant attention due to increasing privacy concerns and the potential
recovery of original facial data. However, as the size of ciphertext template
libraries grows, the face retrieval process becomes progressively more
time-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and efficient
scheme for face retrieval in the ciphertext domain, termed Privacy-Preserving
Preselection for Face Identification Based on Packing (PFIP). PFIP incorporates
an innovative preselection mechanism to reduce computational overhead and a
packing module to enhance the flexibility of biometric systems during the
enrollment stage. Extensive experiments conducted on the LFW and CASIA datasets
demonstrate that PFIP preserves the accuracy of the original face recognition
model, achieving a 100% hit rate while retrieving 1,000 ciphertext face
templates within 300 milliseconds. Compared to existing approaches, PFIP
achieves a nearly 50x improvement in retrieval efficiency.

                                        <span>  Echocardiography (echo) plays an indispensable role in the clinical practice
of heart diseases. However, ultrasound imaging typically provides only
two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images from a few specific views, making
it challenging to interpret and inaccurate for estimation of clinical
parameters like the volume of left ventricle (LV). 3D ultrasound imaging
provides an alternative for 3D quantification, but is still limited by the low
spatial and temporal resolution and the highly demanding manual delineation.
  To address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework for
reconstructing personalized 3D heart anatomy from 2D echo slices that are
frequently used in clinical practice. Specifically, a novel 3D reconstruction
pipeline is designed, which alternatively optimizes between the 3D pose
estimation of these 2D slices and the 3D integration of these slices using an
implicit neural network, progressively transforming a prior 3D heart shape into
a personalized 3D heart model.
  We validate the method with two datasets. When six planes are used, the
reconstructed 3D heart can lead to a significant improvement for LV volume
estimation over the bi-plane method (error in percent: 1.98\% VS. 20.24\%). In
addition, the whole reconstruction framework makes even an important
breakthrough that can estimate RV volume from 2D echo slices (with an error of
5.75\% ). This study provides a new way for personalized 3D structure and
function analysis from cardiac ultrasound and is of great potential in clinical
practice.

                                        <span>  Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance
systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle
due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance
recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is
their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately
detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel
tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the
complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes
two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable
hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning
hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy
without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive
experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly
effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution
for real-world surveillance applications.

the image distribution in a progressive manner while initializing with a simple
distribution and compounding the distribution complexity. Although these models
have unlocked new applicabilities, the sampling mechanism of diffusion does not
offer means to extract image-specific semantic representation, which is
inherently provided by auto-encoders. The encoding component of auto-encoders
enables mapping between a specific image and its latent space, thereby offering
explicit means of enforcing structures in the latent space. By integrating an
encoder with the diffusion model, we establish an auto-encoding formulation,
which learns image-specific representations and offers means to organize the
latent space. In this work, First, we devise a mechanism to structure the
latent space of a diffusion auto-encoding model, towards recognizing
region-specific cellular patterns in brain images. We enforce the
representations to regress positional information of the patches from
high-resolution images. This creates a conducive latent space for
differentiating tissue types of the brain. Second, we devise an unsupervised
tear artifact restoration technique based on neighborhood awareness, utilizing
latent representations and the constrained generation capability of diffusion
models during inference. Third, through representational guidance and
leveraging the inference time steerable noising and denoising capability of
diffusion, we devise an unsupervised JPEG artifact restoration technique.

across different observations. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models rely on
class labels to train supervised models for individual classification. This

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt
representations against supervised features on open-world scenarios and
transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the

with limited data. Moreover, self-supervised features outperform supervision
across all downstream tasks. The code is available here

                                        <span>  Background and objective: Medical image segmentation is a core task in
various clinical applications. However, acquiring large-scale, fully annotated
medical image datasets is both time-consuming and costly. Scribble annotations,
as a form of sparse labeling, provide an efficient and cost-effective
alternative for medical image segmentation. However, the sparsity of scribble
annotations limits the feature learning of the target region and lacks
sufficient boundary supervision, which poses significant challenges for
training segmentation networks. Methods: We propose TAB Net, a novel
weakly-supervised medical image segmentation framework, consisting of two key
components: the triplet augmentation self-recovery (TAS) module and the
boundary-aware pseudo-label supervision (BAP) module. The TAS module enhances
feature learning through three complementary augmentation strategies: intensity
transformation improves the model's sensitivity to texture and contrast
variations, cutout forces the network to capture local anatomical structures by
masking key regions, and jigsaw augmentation strengthens the modeling of global
anatomical layout by disrupting spatial continuity. By guiding the network to
recover complete masks from diverse augmented inputs, TAS promotes a deeper
semantic understanding of medical images under sparse supervision. The BAP
module enhances pseudo-supervision accuracy and boundary modeling by fusing
dual-branch predictions into a loss-weighted pseudo-label and introducing a
boundary-aware loss for fine-grained contour refinement. Results: Experimental
evaluations on two public datasets, ACDC and MSCMR seg, demonstrate that TAB
Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for scribble-based
weakly supervised segmentation. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to
that of fully supervised methods.

temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding
the range of detectable forgery artifacts. Our framework represents a
significant advancement in deepfake video detection, providing robust
performance across diverse and challenging detection scenarios.

bag-level weak labels for large-scale images, such as histopathological whole
slide images (WSIs). However, its adaptability to continual tasks with minimal
forgetting has been rarely explored, especially on instance classification for
localization. Weakly incremental learning for semantic segmentation has been
studied for continual localization, but it focused on natural images,
leveraging global relationships among hundreds of small patches (e.g., $16
\times 16$) using pre-trained models. This approach seems infeasible for MIL
localization due to enormous amounts ($\sim 10^5$) of large patches (e.g., $256
\times 256$) and no available global relationships such as cancer cells. To
address these challenges, we propose Continual Multiple Instance Learning with
Enhanced Localization (CoMEL), an MIL framework for both localization and
adaptability with minimal forgetting. CoMEL consists of (1) Grouped Double
Attention Transformer (GDAT) for efficient instance encoding, (2) Bag
Prototypes-based Pseudo-Labeling (BPPL) for reliable instance pseudo-labeling,
and (3) Orthogonal Weighted Low-Rank Adaptation (OWLoRA) to mitigate forgetting
in both bag and instance classification. Extensive experiments on three public
WSI datasets demonstrate superior performance of CoMEL, outperforming the prior
arts by up to $11.00\%$ in bag-level accuracy and up to $23.4\%$ in
localization accuracy under the continual MIL setup.

scarcity caused by high annotation costs and inherent 2D-to-3D ambiguity.
Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have
been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by
domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single
observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that
uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a
multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific
training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the
pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent
frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in
scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability,
making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.

                                        <span>  Recently, the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) has achieved
a profound impact on the field of artificial intelligence. Numerous advanced
works based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among
them, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,
existing works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly
demanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we
introduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a
collaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data
quality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.
First, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected
videos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,
water turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,
to ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,
resolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and
terrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where
observation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and
environmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action
observation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several
challenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis
of different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that
fine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world
understanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing
in-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text. The dataset and
prompt engineering will be released publicly.

                                        <span>  Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and kinetic modeling are pivotal
in advancing tracer development research in small animal studies. Accurate
kinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally
achieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small
animals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,
precluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully
convolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions
directly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling
in dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial
feature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,
extracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a
temporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The
proposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood
curves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model
applicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected
using two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The
model was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate
shorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts
the arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.
Furthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function
even from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF
from samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not
represented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers
a non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving
robust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations.

                                        <span>  Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing
dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging.
Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are
limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application.
In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our
method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a
complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling
global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple
static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature
shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual
field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to
generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a
result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model
highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only
demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model
larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes. Project page:

a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

                                        <span>  Shrimp diseases are one of the primary causes of economic losses in shrimp
aquaculture. To prevent disease transmission and enhance intelligent detection
efficiency in shrimp farming, this paper proposes a lightweight network
architecture based on YOLOv8n. First, by designing the RLDD detection head and
C2f-EMCM module, the model reduces computational complexity while maintaining
detection accuracy, improving computational efficiency. Subsequently, an
improved SegNext_Attention self-attention mechanism is introduced to further
enhance the model's feature extraction capability, enabling more precise
identification of disease characteristics. Extensive experiments, including
ablation studies and comparative evaluations, are conducted on a
self-constructed shrimp disease dataset, with generalization tests extended to
the URPC2020 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a
32.3% reduction in parameters compared to the original YOLOv8n, with a mAP@0.5
of 92.7% (3% improvement over YOLOv8n). Additionally, the model outperforms
other lightweight YOLO-series models in mAP@0.5, parameter count, and model
size. Generalization experiments on the URPC2020 dataset further validate the
model's robustness, showing a 4.1% increase in mAP@0.5 compared to YOLOv8n. The
proposed method achieves an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency,
providing reliable technical support for intelligent disease detection in
shrimp aquaculture.

                                        <span>  Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

                                        <span>  Rice leaf diseases significantly reduce productivity and cause economic
losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

precise spatial control over generated outputs remains challenging. ControlNet
addresses this by introducing an auxiliary conditioning module, while
ControlNet++ further refines alignment through a cycle consistency loss applied
only to the final denoising steps. However, this approach neglects intermediate
generation stages, limiting its effectiveness. We propose InnerControl, a
training strategy that enforces spatial consistency across all diffusion steps.
Our method trains lightweight convolutional probes to reconstruct input control
signals (e.g., edges, depth) from intermediate UNet features at every denoising
step. These probes efficiently extract signals even from highly noisy latents,
enabling pseudo ground truth controls for training. By minimizing the
discrepancy between predicted and target conditions throughout the entire
diffusion process, our alignment loss improves both control fidelity and
generation quality. Combined with established techniques like ControlNet++,
InnerControl achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse conditioning
methods (e.g., edges, depth).

metrics primarily capture visual quality and temporal consistency, offering
limited insight into how synthetic videos perform in downstream tasks such as
text-to-video retrieval (TVR). In this work, we introduce SynTVA, a new dataset
and benchmark designed to evaluate the utility of synthetic videos for building
retrieval models. Based on 800 diverse user queries derived from MSRVTT
training split, we generate synthetic videos using state-of-the-art T2V models
and annotate each video-text pair along four key semantic alignment dimensions:
Object \& Scene, Action, Attribute, and Prompt Fidelity. Our evaluation
framework correlates general video quality assessment (VQA) metrics with these
alignment scores, and examines their predictive power for downstream TVR
performance. To explore pathways of scaling up, we further develop an
Auto-Evaluator to estimate alignment quality from existing metrics. Beyond
benchmarking, our results show that SynTVA is a valuable asset for dataset
augmentation, enabling the selection of high-utility synthetic samples that
measurably improve TVR outcomes. Project page and dataset can be found at

                                        <span>  Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

reconstructing with high fidelity perceived visual stimuli from neural
activity, e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), in the human
visual cortex. Most existing methods decode the brain signal using a two-level
strategy, i.e., pixel-level and semantic-level. However, these methods rely
heavily on low-level pixel alignment yet lack sufficient and fine-grained
semantic alignment, resulting in obvious reconstruction distortions of multiple
semantic objects. To better understand the brain's visual perception patterns
and how current decoding models process semantic objects, we have developed an
experimental framework that uses fMRI representations as intervention
conditions. By injecting these representations into multi-scale image features
via cross-attention, we compare both downstream performance and intermediate
feature changes on object detection and instance segmentation tasks with and
without fMRI information. Our results demonstrate that incorporating fMRI
signals enhances the accuracy of downstream detection and segmentation,
confirming that fMRI contains rich multi-object semantic cues and coarse
spatial localization information-elements that current models have yet to fully
exploit or integrate.

overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

weakly-supervised by only category labels. This is achieved by transforming
discriminatively-trained intermediate layer filters into keypoint detectors. We
begin by identifying three preferred characteristics of keypoint detectors: (i)
spatially sparse activations, (ii) consistency and (iii) diversity. Instead of
relying on hand-crafted loss terms, a novel computationally-efficient leaky max
pooling (LMP) layer is proposed to explicitly encourage final conv-layer
filters to learn "non-repeatable local patterns" that are well aligned with
object keypoints. Informed by visualizations, a simple yet effective selection
strategy is proposed to ensure consistent filter activations and attention
mask-out is then applied to force the network to distribute its attention to
the whole object instead of just the most discriminative region. For the final
keypoint prediction, a learnable clustering layer is proposed to group keypoint
proposals into keypoint predictions. The final model, named LMPNet, is highly
interpretable in that it directly manipulates network filters to detect
predefined concepts. Our experiments show that LMPNet can (i) automatically
discover semantic keypoints that are robust to object pose and (ii) achieves
strong prediction accuracy comparable to a supervised pose estimation model.

bitemporal images taken at the same location. Besides significant changes, slow
changes in bitemporal images are also important in real-life scenarios. For
instance, weak changes often serve as precursors to major hazards in scenarios
like slopes, dams, and tailings ponds. Therefore, designing a change detection
network that simultaneously detects slow and fast changes presents a novel
challenge. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a change
detection network named Flow-CDNet, consisting of two branches: optical flow
branch and binary change detection branch. The first branch utilizes a pyramid
structure to extract displacement changes at multiple scales. The second one
combines a ResNet-based network with the optical flow branch's output to
generate fast change outputs. Subsequently, to supervise and evaluate this new
change detection framework, a self-built change detection dataset Flow-Change,
a loss function combining binary tversky loss and L2 norm loss, along with a
new evaluation metric called FEPE are designed. Quantitative experiments
conducted on Flow-Change dataset demonstrated that our approach outperforms the
existing methods. Furthermore, ablation experiments verified that the two
branches can promote each other to enhance the detection performance.

effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

Specifically, DreamComposer++ utilizes a view-aware 3D lifting module to

target view through the multi-view feature fusion module. Finally, the obtained
features of target view are integrated into pre-trained image or video

that DreamComposer++ seamlessly integrates with cutting-edge view-aware

strong generalization in generic segmentation tasks. However, applying SAM to
remote sensing (RS) images still faces two major challenges. First, manually
constructing precise prompts for each image (e.g., points or boxes) is
labor-intensive and inefficient, especially in RS scenarios with dense small
objects or spatially fragmented distributions. Second, SAM lacks domain
adaptability, as it is pre-trained primarily on natural images and struggles to
capture RS-specific semantics and spatial characteristics, especially when
segmenting novel or unseen classes. To address these issues, inspired by
few-shot learning, we propose ViRefSAM, a novel framework that guides SAM
utilizing only a few annotated reference images that contain class-specific
objects. Without requiring manual prompts, ViRefSAM enables automatic
segmentation of class-consistent objects across RS images. Specifically,
ViRefSAM introduces two key components while keeping SAM's original
architecture intact: (1) a Visual Contextual Prompt Encoder that extracts
class-specific semantic clues from reference images and generates object-aware
prompts via contextual interaction with target images; and (2) a Dynamic Target
Alignment Adapter, integrated into SAM's image encoder, which mitigates the
domain gap by injecting class-specific semantics into target image features,
enabling SAM to dynamically focus on task-relevant regions. Extensive
experiments on three few-shot segmentation benchmarks, including iSAID-5$^i$,
LoveDA-2$^i$, and COCO-20$^i$, demonstrate that ViRefSAM enables accurate and
automatic segmentation of unseen classes by leveraging only a few reference
images and consistently outperforms existing few-shot segmentation methods
across diverse datasets.

imaging can respectively identify scarring and edema areas, both of which are

combining complementary information from multi-sequence CMR is useful,
acquiring these sequences can be time-consuming and prohibitive, e.g., due to
the administration of contrast agents. Cine CMR is a rapid and contrast-free

CineMyoPS extracts both motion and anatomy features associated with MI. Given

Furthermore, we propose a time-series aggregation strategy to integrate

                                        <span>  Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to develop a versatile model capable of
performing effectively on unseen target domains. Notably, recent advances in
pre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
considerable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep
learning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain
prompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of
disentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical
challenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging
the controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text
modality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel
framework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first
automatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)
and then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the
disentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual
feature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be
too complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address
this, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which
extends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of
abstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through
stylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual
representations remain consistent across both the original and augmented
distributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,
VLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.

Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their
potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo
(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective
token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo
introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that
systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,
and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that
preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments
indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens
in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior
effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method
improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while
maintaining strong performance.

crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

visibility and color issues due to light changes, water turbidity, and bubbles.
Traditional prior-based methods and pixel-based methods often fail, while deep
learning lacks sufficient high-quality datasets. We introduce the Multi-Axis
Conditional Lookup (MAC-Lookup) model, which enhances visual quality by
improving color accuracy, sharpness, and contrast. It includes Conditional 3D
Lookup Table Color Correction (CLTCC) for preliminary color and quality
correction and Multi-Axis Adaptive Enhancement (MAAE) for detail refinement.
This model prevents over-enhancement and saturation while handling underwater

underwater images by restoring details and colors better than existing methods.

fine-grained land cover classes. Typically, satellite or airborne images used
for training and testing are acquired from different regions or times, where
the same class has significant spectral shifts in different scenes. In this
paper, we propose a Bi-directional Domain Adaptation (BiDA) framework for
cross-domain hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which focuses on
extracting both domain-invariant features and domain-specific information in
the independent adaptive space, thereby enhancing the adaptability and
separability to the target scene. In the proposed BiDA, a triple-branch
transformer architecture (the source branch, target branch, and coupled branch)
with semantic tokenizer is designed as the backbone. Specifically, the source
branch and target branch independently learn the adaptive space of source and
target domains, a Coupled Multi-head Cross-attention (CMCA) mechanism is
developed in coupled branch for feature interaction and inter-domain
correlation mining. Furthermore, a bi-directional distillation loss is designed
to guide adaptive space learning using inter-domain correlation. Finally, we
propose an Adaptive Reinforcement Strategy (ARS) to encourage the model to
focus on specific generalized feature extraction within both source and target
scenes in noise condition. Experimental results on cross-temporal/scene
airborne and satellite datasets demonstrate that the proposed BiDA performs
significantly better than some state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.
In the cross-temporal tree species classification task, the proposed BiDA is
more than 3\%$\sim$5\% higher than the most advanced method. The codes will be

and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and

                                        <span>  Precise surgical interventions are vital to patient safety, and advanced
enhancement algorithms have been developed to assist surgeons in
decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness
in complex real-world situations. To address this limitation, we propose
SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its
potential as a unified solution for surgical assistance.

However, inherent limitations of fewframe images and redundancy in 3D space
compromise prediction accuracy for occluded and distant scenes. Existing
methods enhance performance by fusing historical frame data, which need
additional data and significant computational resources. To address these
issues, this paper propose FMOcc, a Tri-perspective View (TPV) refinement
occupancy network with flow matching selective state space model for few-frame
3D occupancy prediction. Firstly, to generate missing features, we designed a
feature refinement module based on a flow matching model, which is called Flow
Matching SSM module (FMSSM). Furthermore, by designing the TPV SSM layer and
Plane Selective SSM (PS3M), we selectively filter TPV features to reduce the
impact of air voxels on non-air voxels, thereby enhancing the overall
efficiency of the model and prediction capability for distant scenes. Finally,
we design the Mask Training (MT) method to enhance the robustness of FMOcc and
address the issue of sensor data loss. Experimental results on the
Occ3D-nuScenes and OpenOcc datasets show that our FMOcc outperforms existing
state-of-theart methods. Our FMOcc with two frame input achieves notable scores
of 43.1% RayIoU and 39.8% mIoU on Occ3D-nuScenes validation, 42.6% RayIoU on
OpenOcc with 5.4 G inference memory and 330ms inference time.

                                        <span>  Drones are increasingly used in forestry to capture high-resolution remote
sensing data, supporting enhanced monitoring, assessment, and decision-making
processes. While operations above the forest canopy are already highly
automated, flying inside forests remains challenging, primarily relying on
manual piloting. Inside dense forests, reliance on the Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) for localization is not feasible. Additionally, the
drone must autonomously adjust its flight path to avoid collisions. Recently,
advancements in robotics have enabled autonomous drone flights in GNSS-denied
obstacle-rich areas. In this article, a step towards autonomous forest data
collection is taken by building a prototype of a robotic under-canopy drone
utilizing state-of-the-art open-source methods and validating its performance
for data collection inside forests. Specifically, the study focused on
camera-based autonomous flight under the forest canopy and photogrammetric
post-processing of the data collected with the low-cost onboard stereo camera.
The autonomous flight capability of the prototype was evaluated through
multiple test flights at boreal forests. The tree parameter estimation
capability was studied by performing diameter at breast height (DBH)
estimation. The prototype successfully carried out flights in selected
challenging forest environments, and the experiments showed excellent
performance in forest 3D modeling with a miniaturized stereoscopic
photogrammetric system. The DBH estimation achieved a root mean square error
(RMSE) of 3.33 cm (12.79 \%) across all trees. For trees with a DBH less than
30 cm, the RMSE was 1.16 cm (5.74 \%). The results provide valuable insights
into autonomous under-canopy forest mapping and highlight the critical next
steps for advancing lightweight robotic drone systems for mapping complex
forest environments.

textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a paradigm where models conduct reasoning
within language. This text-centric approach, however, treats vision as a
static, initial context, creating a fundamental "semantic gap" between rich
perceptual data and discrete symbolic thought. Human cognition often transcends
language, utilizing vision as a dynamic mental sketchpad. A similar evolution
is now unfolding in AI, marking a fundamental paradigm shift from models that
merely think about images to those that can truly think with images. This
emerging paradigm is characterized by models leveraging visual information as
intermediate steps in their thought process, transforming vision from a passive
input into a dynamic, manipulable cognitive workspace. In this survey, we chart
this evolution of intelligence along a trajectory of increasing cognitive
autonomy, which unfolds across three key stages: from external tool
exploration, through programmatic manipulation, to intrinsic imagination. To
structure this rapidly evolving field, our survey makes four key contributions.
(1) We establish the foundational principles of the think with image paradigm
and its three-stage framework. (2) We provide a comprehensive review of the
core methods that characterize each stage of this roadmap. (3) We analyze the
critical landscape of evaluation benchmarks and transformative applications.
(4) We identify significant challenges and outline promising future directions.
By providing this structured overview, we aim to offer a clear roadmap for
future research towards more powerful and human-aligned multimodal AI.

classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and
underutilized spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple
shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes,
causing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose
Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates
phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in
the Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving
complementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior
approaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency
spectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for
multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase
Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via
convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude
Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and
low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons,
leveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness.
Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available

                                        <span>  The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to
the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture
essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and
spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we
present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated
dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic
panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset
includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a
terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset
were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate
individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples.
This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a
structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the
maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step
optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We
conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in
segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata
annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and
quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k
points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational
tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for
AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in
agricultural research.

                                        <span>  Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

\emph{Text-based CAD editing}, which automates the modification of CAD models
based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored.
Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based
CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting
existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first
framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding
triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated
data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to
generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing
instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we
propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two
focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these
regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the
backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language
understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves
superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. The code is

ultrasound images is limited, which restricts the training of machine learning
models. In this paper, we investigate the use of diffusion models to generate
synthetic ultrasound images to improve the performance on fetal plane
classification. We train different classifiers first on synthetic images and
then fine-tune them with real images. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating generated images into training pipelines leads
to better classification accuracy than training with real images alone. The
findings suggest that generating synthetic data using diffusion models can be a
valuable tool in overcoming the challenges of data scarcity in ultrasound
medical imaging.

targeting, such as robotic biopsies. We introduce LUDO, a method for accurate
low-latency understanding of deformable objects. LUDO reconstructs objects in
their deformed state, including their internal structures, from a single-view
point cloud observation in under 30 ms using occupancy networks. LUDO provides
uncertainty estimates for its predictions. Additionally, it provides
explainability by highlighting key features in its input observations. Both
uncertainty and explainability are important for safety-critical applications
such as surgery. We evaluate LUDO in real-world robotic experiments, achieving
a success rate of 98.9% for puncturing various regions of interest (ROIs)
inside deformable objects. We compare LUDO to a popular baseline and show its
superior ROI localization accuracy, training time, and memory requirements.
LUDO demonstrates the potential to interact with deformable objects without the
need for deformable registration methods.

synthetic representations, has emerged as a critical solution for training
modern deep learning models efficiently. While prior surveys focus on
developments before 2023, this work comprehensively reviews recent advances,
emphasizing scalability to large-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K and
ImageNet-21K. We categorize progress into a few key methodologies: trajectory

                                        <span>  Automatic robotic facial expression generation is crucial for human-robot
interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often
yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques
reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately
bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a
deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of
freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a
novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this
discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we
conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and
develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese
RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via
Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform
demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and
socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those
generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our
framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model
predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human
affective responses.

Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and
temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time,
minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg,
Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to
compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for
the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and
validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our
results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with
high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include
camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions
affecting traffic flow.

challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

                                        <span>  Challenges in remote sensing object detection(RSOD), such as high interclass
similarity, imbalanced foreground-background distribution, and the small size
of objects in remote sensing images, significantly hinder detection accuracy.
Moreover, the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational complexity
poses additional constraints on the application of RSOD algorithms. To address
these issues, this study proposes an efficient and lightweight RSOD algorithm
integrating multiscale receptive fields and foreground focus mechanism, named
robust foreground weighted network(RFWNet). Specifically, we proposed a
lightweight backbone network receptive field adaptive selection network
(RFASNet), leveraging the rich context information of remote sensing images to
enhance class separability. Additionally, we developed a foreground-background
separation module(FBSM)consisting of a background redundant information
filtering module (BRIFM) and a foreground information enhancement module (FIEM)
to emphasize critical regions within images while filtering redundant
background information. Finally, we designed a loss function, the weighted
CIoU-Wasserstein loss (LWCW),which weights the IoU-based loss by using the
normalized Wasserstein distance to mitigate model sensitivity to small object
position deviations. The comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that
RFWNet achieved 95.3% and 73.2% mean average precision (mAP) with 6.0 M
parameters on the DOTA V1.0 and NWPU VHR-10 datasets, respectively, with an
inference speed of 52 FPS.

shapes. This inspires us to examine the value of these cells in promoting the
research of medical image segmentation. In this paper, we design a Similarity

we propose a Dynamic Memory Weights-Loss Attention (DMW-LA), which matches and
remembers the category features of specific lesions or organs in medical images
through the similarity memory prior in the prototype memory bank, thus helping
the network to learn subtle texture changes between categories. DMW-LA also
dynamically updates the similarity memory prior in reverse through Weight-Loss
Dynamic (W-LD) update strategy, effectively assisting the network directly
extract category features. In addition, we propose the Double-Similarity Global
Internal Enhancement Module (DS-GIM) to deeply explore the internal differences
in the feature distribution of input data through cosine similarity and
euclidean distance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that
Sim-MPNet has better segmentation performance than other state-of-the-art

                                        <span>  Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

                                        <span>  Weakly supervised segmentation methods can delineate thyroid nodules in
ultrasound images efficiently using training data with coarse labels, but
suffer from: 1) low-confidence pseudo-labels that follow topological priors,
introducing significant label noise, and 2) low-rationality loss functions that
rigidly compare segmentation with labels, ignoring discriminative information
for nodules with diverse and complex shapes. To solve these issues, we clarify
the objective and references for weakly supervised ultrasound image
segmentation, presenting a framework with high-confidence pseudo-labels to
represent topological and anatomical information and high-rationality losses to
capture multi-level discriminative features. Specifically, we fuse geometric
transformations of four-point annotations and MedSAM model results prompted by
specific annotations to generate high-confidence box, foreground, and
background labels. Our high-rationality learning strategy includes: 1)
Alignment loss measuring spatial consistency between segmentation and box
label, and topological continuity within the foreground label, guiding the
network to perceive nodule location; 2) Contrastive loss pulling features from
labeled foreground regions while pushing features from labeled foreground and
background regions, guiding the network to learn nodule and background feature
distribution; 3) Prototype correlation loss measuring consistency between
correlation maps derived by comparing features with foreground and background
prototypes, refining uncertain regions to accurate nodule edges. Experimental
results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TN3K
and DDTI datasets. The code is available at

                                        <span>  Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have great potential in medical tasks, like
Visual Question Answering (VQA), where they could act as interactive assistants
for both patients and clinicians. Yet their robustness to distribution shifts
on unseen data remains a key concern for safe deployment. Evaluating such
robustness requires a controlled experimental setup that allows for systematic
insights into the model's behavior. However, we demonstrate that current setups
fail to offer sufficiently thorough evaluations. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel framework, called SURE-VQA, centered around three key
requirements to overcome current pitfalls and systematically analyze VLM
robustness: 1) Since robustness on synthetic shifts does not necessarily
translate to real-world shifts, it should be measured on real-world shifts that
are inherent to the VQA data; 2) Traditional token-matching metrics often fail
to capture underlying semantics, necessitating the use of large language models
(LLMs) for more accurate semantic evaluation; 3) Model performance often lacks
interpretability due to missing sanity baselines, thus meaningful baselines
should be reported that allow assessing the multimodal impact on the VLM. To
demonstrate the relevance of this framework, we conduct a study on the
robustness of various Fine-Tuning (FT) methods across three medical datasets
with four types of distribution shifts. Our study highlights key insights into
robustness: 1) No FT method consistently outperforms others in robustness, and
2) robustness trends are more stable across FT methods than across distribution
shifts. Additionally, we find that simple sanity baselines that do not use the
image data can perform surprisingly well and confirm LoRA as the
best-performing FT method on in-distribution data. Code is provided at

                                        <span>  Panoramic optical flow enables a comprehensive understanding of temporal
dynamics across wide fields of view. However, severe distortions caused by
sphere-to-plane projections, such as the equirectangular projection (ERP),
significantly degrade the performance of conventional perspective-based optical
flow methods, especially in polar regions. To address this challenge, we
propose PriOr-Flow, a novel dual-branch framework that leverages the
low-distortion nature of the orthogonal view to enhance optical flow estimation
in these regions. Specifically, we introduce the Dual-Cost Collaborative Lookup
(DCCL) operator, which jointly retrieves correlation information from both the
primitive and orthogonal cost volumes, effectively mitigating distortion noise
during cost volume construction. Furthermore, our Ortho-Driven Distortion
Compensation (ODDC) module iteratively refines motion features from both
branches, further suppressing polar distortions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PriOr-Flow is compatible with various perspective-based
iterative optical flow methods and consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance on publicly available panoramic optical flow datasets, setting a
new benchmark for wide-field motion estimation. The code is publicly available

fairness more than other bias mitigation approaches while slightly improving

flexibility. Conditional generative models depend heavily on expensive
annotated training data. Meanwhile, recent frameworks, which leverage
pre-trained vision-language models, are limited by either per text-prompt
optimization or inference-time hyper-parameters tuning. In this work, we
propose a novel framework named \textit{DeltaEdit} to address these problems.
Our key idea is to investigate and identify a space, namely delta image and
text space that has well-aligned distribution between CLIP visual feature
differences of two images and CLIP textual embedding differences of source and
target texts. Based on the CLIP delta space, the DeltaEdit network is designed
to map the CLIP visual features differences to the editing directions of
StyleGAN at training phase. Then, in inference phase, DeltaEdit predicts the
StyleGAN's editing directions from the differences of the CLIP textual
features. In this way, DeltaEdit is trained in a text-free manner. Once
trained, it can well generalize to various text prompts for zero-shot inference
without bells and whistles.

comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The project page is

                                        <span>  Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging
tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are
trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the
strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image
segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of
publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation
algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias
mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based
CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance
reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to
mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root
causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using
models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be
mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the
underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority
White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for
both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias
mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing
the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation
performance and no statistically significant bias.

                                        <span>  Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

                                        <span>  Attention operator has been widely used as a basic brick in visual
understanding since it provides some flexibility through its adjustable
kernels. However, this operator suffers from inherent limitations: (1) the
attention kernel is not discriminative enough, resulting in high redundancy,
and (2) the complexity in computation and memory is quadratic in the sequence
length. In this paper, we propose a novel attention operator, called
Lightweight Structure-aware Attention (LiSA), which has a better representation
power with log-linear complexity. Our operator transforms the attention kernels
to be more discriminative by learning structural patterns. These structural
patterns are encoded by exploiting a set of relative position embeddings (RPEs)
as multiplicative weights, thereby improving the representation power of the
attention kernels. Additionally, the RPEs are approximated to obtain log-linear
complexity. Our experiments and analyses demonstrate that the proposed operator
outperforms self-attention and other existing operators, achieving
state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-1K and other downstream tasks such as
video action recognition on Kinetics-400, object detection \& instance
segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE-20K.

                                        <span>  A single-pass driving clip frequently results in incomplete scanning of the
road structure, making reconstructed scene expanding a critical requirement for
sensor simulators to effectively regress driving actions. Although contemporary
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques achieve remarkable reconstruction
quality, their direct extension through the integration of diffusion priors
often introduces cumulative physical inconsistencies and compromises training
efficiency. To address these limitations, we present RGE-GS, a novel expansive
reconstruction framework that synergizes diffusion-based generation with
reward-guided Gaussian integration. The RGE-GS framework incorporates two key
innovations: First, we propose a reward network that learns to identify and
prioritize consistently generated patterns prior to reconstruction phases,
thereby enabling selective retention of diffusion outputs for spatial
stability. Second, during the reconstruction process, we devise a
differentiated training strategy that automatically adjust Gaussian
optimization progress according to scene converge metrics, which achieving
better convergence than baseline methods. Extensive evaluations of publicly
available datasets demonstrate that RGE-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in reconstruction quality. Our source-code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/CN-ADLab/RGE-GS.

to aggregate a full cost volume, but their computational demands make mobile
deployment challenging. Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation
often results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless
regions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative
warping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not
mobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we
present a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo
matching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details
using only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost
volume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then
perform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to
obtain the final disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our
BANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving
35.3\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D,
with faster runtime on mobile devices. Code:

                                        <span>  This paper introduces Stereo Any Video, a powerful framework for video stereo
matching. It can estimate spatially accurate and temporally consistent
disparities without relying on auxiliary information such as camera poses or
optical flow. The strong capability is driven by rich priors from monocular
video depth models, which are integrated with convolutional features to produce
stable representations. To further enhance performance, key architectural
innovations are introduced: all-to-all-pairs correlation, which constructs
smooth and robust matching cost volumes, and temporal convex upsampling, which
improves temporal coherence. These components collectively ensure robustness,
accuracy, and temporal consistency, setting a new standard in video stereo
matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets both qualitatively and
quantitatively in zero-shot settings, as well as strong generalization to
real-world indoor and outdoor scenarios.

significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

                                        <span>  Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have delivered remarkable performance in
Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, recent methods often
overlook the fact that visual cues are susceptible, whereas the underlying
geometry remains stable, rendering depth information more robust. In this
paper, we investigate the potential of integrating depth information with
features from VFMs, to improve the geometric consistency within an image and
boost the generalization performance of VFMs. We propose a novel fine-tuning
DGSS framework, named DepthForge, which integrates the visual cues from frozen
DINOv2 or EVA02 and depth cues from frozen Depth Anything V2. In each layer of
the VFMs, we incorporate depth-aware learnable tokens to continuously decouple
domain-invariant visual and spatial information, thereby enhancing depth
awareness and attention of the VFMs. Finally, we develop a depth refinement
decoder and integrate it into the model architecture to adaptively refine
multi-layer VFM features and depth-aware learnable tokens. Extensive
experiments are conducted based on various DGSS settings and five different
datsets as unseen target domains. The qualitative and quantitative results
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms alternative approaches
with stronger performance, steadier visual-spatial attention, and superior
generalization ability. In particular, DepthForge exhibits outstanding
performance under extreme conditions (e.g., night and snow). Code is available

                                        <span>  Incurable diseases continue to pose major challenges to global healthcare
systems, with their prevalence shaped by lifestyle, economic, social, and
genetic factors. Among these, kidney disease remains a critical global health
issue, requiring ongoing research to improve early diagnosis and treatment. In
recent years, deep learning (DL) has shown promise in medical imaging and
diagnostics, driving significant progress in automatic kidney cancer (KC)
detection. However, the success of DL models depends heavily on the
availability of high-quality, domain-specific datasets, which are often limited
and expensive to acquire. Moreover, DL models demand substantial computational
power and storage, restricting their real-world clinical use. To overcome these
barriers, transfer learning (TL) has emerged as an effective approach, enabling
the reuse of pre-trained models from related domains to enhance KC diagnosis.
This paper presents a comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for KC
detection, systematically reviewing key methodologies, their advantages, and
limitations, and analyzing their practical performance. It further discusses
challenges in applying TL to medical imaging and highlights emerging trends
that could influence future research. This review demonstrates the
transformative role of TL in precision medicine, particularly oncology, by
improving diagnostic accuracy, lowering computational demands, and supporting
the integration of AI-powered tools in healthcare. The insights provided offer
valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners, paving the way for future
advances in KC diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the
most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which
has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as
Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL
models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,
especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the
other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can
provide important information for learning good representations that can be
transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an
anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical
information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves
state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To
validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the
diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum
disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10
different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings
show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to
more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found

cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a
shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in
guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality
standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges:
(1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant
individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged
structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to
a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically
adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior
scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired
by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method.
Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac
structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe
movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can
predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of
personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert
scanning dataset with 1.31 million samples demonstrate that our proposed
sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared
to other advanced baseline methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

                                        <span>  State-of-the-art supervised stereo matching methods have achieved remarkable
performance on various benchmarks. However, their generalization to real-world
scenarios remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated real-world
stereo data. In this paper, we propose ZeroStereo, a novel stereo image
generation pipeline for zero-shot stereo matching. Our approach synthesizes
high-quality right images from arbitrary single images by leveraging pseudo
disparities generated by a monocular depth estimation model. Unlike previous
methods that address occluded regions by filling missing areas with neighboring
pixels or random backgrounds, we fine-tune a diffusion inpainting model to
recover missing details while preserving semantic structure. Additionally, we
propose Training-Free Confidence Generation, which mitigates the impact of
unreliable pseudo labels without additional training, and Adaptive Disparity
Selection, which ensures a diverse and realistic disparity distribution while
preventing excessive occlusion and foreground distortion. Experiments
demonstrate that models trained with our pipeline achieve state-of-the-art
zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets with only a dataset volume
comparable to Scene Flow. Code: https://github.com/Windsrain/ZeroStereo.

Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet their computational costs surge drastically
when scaling resolution, training data, and model parameters. A key bottleneck
stems from the proliferation of visual tokens required for fine-grained image
understanding. We propose Skip-Vision, a unified framework addressing both
training and inference inefficiencies in vision-language models. On top of
conventional token compression approaches, our method introduces two
complementary acceleration strategies. For training acceleration, we observe
that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) computations on visual tokens induce marginal
feature updates. This motivates our Skip-FFN strategy, which bypasses FFN
layers for redundant visual tokens. For inference acceleration, we design a
selective KV-cache removal mechanism that prunes the skipped key-value pairs
during decoding while preserving model performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that Skip-Vision reduces training time by up to 35\%, inference
FLOPs by 75\%, and latency by 45\%, while achieving comparable or superior
performance to existing methods. Our work provides a practical solution for
scaling high-performance MLLMs with enhanced efficiency.

                                        <span>  Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

daily life, robotic-generated videos have begun to appear on streaming media
platforms, enabling us to envision a future where humans and robots coexist. We
innovatively propose the concept of Robotic-Generated Content (RGC) to term
these videos generated from egocentric perspective of robots. The perceptual
quality of RGC videos is critical in human-robot interaction scenarios, and RGC
videos exhibit unique distortions and visual requirements that differ markedly
from those of professionally-generated content (PGC) videos and user-generated
content (UGC) videos. However, dedicated research on quality assessment of RGC
videos is still lacking. To address this gap and to support broader robotic
applications, we establish the first Robotic-Generated Content Database (RGCD),
which contains a total of 2,100 videos drawn from three robot categories and
sourced from diverse platforms. A subjective VQA experiment is conducted
subsequently to assess human visual perception of robotic-generated videos.
Finally, we conduct a benchmark experiment to evaluate the performance of 11
state-of-the-art VQA models on our database. Experimental results reveal
significant limitations in existing VQA models when applied to complex,
robotic-generated content, highlighting a critical need for RGC-specific VQA
models. Our RGCD is publicly available at:

electronic waste, which promotes building a sustainable future. To this end,
the Danish Technological Institute (DTI) focuses on the research and
development of several robotic applications empowered with software, including
laptop refurbishing. Cleaning represents a major step in refurbishing and
involves identifying and removing stickers from laptop surfaces. Software plays
a crucial role in the cleaning process. For instance, the software integrates
various object detection models to identify and remove stickers from laptops
automatically. However, given the diversity in types of stickers (e.g., shapes,
colors, locations), identification of the stickers is highly uncertain, thereby
requiring explicit quantification of uncertainty associated with the identified
stickers. Such uncertainty quantification can help reduce risks in removing
stickers, which, for example, could otherwise result in software faults
damaging laptop surfaces. For uncertainty quantification, we adopted the Monte
Carlo Dropout method to evaluate six sticker detection models (SDMs) from DTI
using three datasets: the original image dataset from DTI and two datasets
generated with vision language models, i.e., DALL-E-3 and Stable Diffusion-3.
In addition, we presented novel robustness metrics concerning detection
accuracy and uncertainty to assess the robustness of the SDMs based on
adversarial datasets generated from the three datasets using a dense adversary
method.
  Our evaluation results show that different SDMs perform differently regarding
different metrics. Based on the results, we provide SDM selection guidelines
and lessons learned from various perspectives.

particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential
under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB
histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their
sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method
utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to
estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse
images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate
the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their
directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting
environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source
localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement.
Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient

                                        <span>  The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

                                        <span>  Remote Sensing Image Captioning (RSIC) is the process of generating
meaningful descriptions from remote sensing images. Recently, it has gained
significant attention, with encoder-decoder models serving as the backbone for
generating meaningful captions. The encoder extracts essential visual features
from the input image, transforming them into a compact representation, while
the decoder utilizes this representation to generate coherent textual
descriptions. Recently, transformer-based models have gained significant
popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and
contextual information. The decoder has been well explored for text generation,
whereas the encoder remains relatively unexplored. However, optimizing the
encoder is crucial as it directly influences the richness of extracted
features, which in turn affects the quality of generated captions. To address
this gap, we systematically evaluate twelve different convolutional neural
network (CNN) architectures within a transformer-based encoder framework to
assess their effectiveness in RSIC. The evaluation consists of two stages:
first, a numerical analysis categorizes CNNs into different clusters, based on
their performance. The best performing CNNs are then subjected to human
evaluation from a human-centric perspective by a human annotator. Additionally,
we analyze the impact of different search strategies, namely greedy search and
beam search, to ensure the best caption. The results highlight the critical
role of encoder selection in improving captioning performance, demonstrating
that specific CNN architectures significantly enhance the quality of generated
descriptions for remote sensing images. By providing a detailed comparison of
multiple encoders, this study offers valuable insights to guide advances in
transformer-based image captioning models.

ventral and dorsal streams in our human brain, are two key components of
autonomous driving perception systems. Addressing these two tasks with separate
networks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision
algorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and
embodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them
within a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing
between the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in
comprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a
tightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep
supervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined
use of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art
joint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and
stereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2
datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the
effectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate
its superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in

                                        <span>  The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has inspired the development of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for unified understanding of vision
and language. However, the increasing model size and computational complexity
of large-scale MLLMs (l-MLLMs) limit their use in resource-constrained
scenarios. Although small-scale MLLMs (s-MLLMs) are designed to reduce
computational costs, they typically suffer from performance degradation. To
mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel LLaVA-KD framework to transfer
knowledge from l-MLLMs to s-MLLMs. Specifically, we introduce Multimodal
Distillation (MDist) to transfer teacher model's robust representations across
both visual and linguistic modalities, and Relation Distillation (RDist) to
transfer teacher model's ability to capture visual token relationships.
Additionally, we propose a three-stage training scheme to fully exploit the
potential of the proposed distillation strategy: 1) Distilled Pre-Training to
strengthen the alignment between visual-linguistic representations in s-MLLMs,
2) Supervised Fine-Tuning to equip the s-MLLMs with multimodal understanding
capacity, and 3) Distilled Fine-Tuning to refine s-MLLM's knowledge. Our
approach significantly improves s-MLLMs performance without altering the model
architecture. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of each proposed component. Code will be available at

benefit downstream planning tasks, highlighting the practical advantages of our

diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

                                        <span>  Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to online adapt a pre-trained
model to changing environments during inference. Most existing methods focus on
exploiting target data, while overlooking another crucial source of
information, the pre-trained weights, which encode underutilized
domain-invariant priors. This paper takes the geometric attributes of
pre-trained weights as a starting point, systematically analyzing three key
components: magnitude, absolute angle, and pairwise angular structure. We find
that the pairwise angular structure remains stable across diverse corrupted
domains and encodes domain-invariant semantic information, suggesting it should
be preserved during adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose PAID
(Pairwise Angular-Invariant Decomposition), a prior-driven CTTA method that
decomposes weight into magnitude and direction, and introduces a learnable
orthogonal matrix via Householder reflections to globally rotate direction
while preserving the pairwise angular structure. During adaptation, only the
magnitudes and the orthogonal matrices are updated. PAID achieves consistent
improvements over recent SOTA methods on four widely used CTTA benchmarks,
demonstrating that preserving pairwise angular structure offers a simple yet
effective principle for CTTA.

                                        <span>  Existing makeup techniques often require designing multiple models to handle
different inputs and align features across domains for different makeup tasks,
e.g., beauty filter, makeup transfer, and makeup removal, leading to increased
complexity. Another limitation is the absence of text-guided makeup try-on,
which is more user-friendly without needing reference images. In this study, we
make the first attempt to use a single model for various makeup tasks.
Specifically, we formulate different makeup tasks as cross-domain translations
and leverage a cross-domain diffusion model to accomplish all tasks. Unlike
existing methods that rely on separate encoder-decoder configurations or
cycle-based mechanisms, we propose using different domain embeddings to
facilitate domain control. This allows for seamless domain switching by merely
changing embeddings with a single model, thereby reducing the reliance on
additional modules for different tasks. Moreover, to support precise
text-to-makeup applications, we introduce the MT-Text dataset by extending the
MT dataset with textual annotations, advancing the practicality of makeup
technologies.

is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision
approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify
bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos
for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage
vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to
generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB
videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that
processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation
on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes
shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and
sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection.
Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the
sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing
model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

                                        <span>  The rise of autonomous vehicles has significantly increased the demand for
robust 3D object detection systems. While cameras and LiDAR sensors each offer
unique advantages--cameras provide rich texture information and LiDAR offers
precise 3D spatial data--relying on a single modality often leads to
performance limitations. This paper introduces MV2DFusion, a multi-modal
detection framework that integrates the strengths of both worlds through an
advanced query-based fusion mechanism. By introducing an image query generator
to align with image-specific attributes and a point cloud query generator,
MV2DFusion effectively combines modality-specific object semantics without
biasing toward one single modality. Then the sparse fusion process can be
accomplished based on the valuable object semantics, ensuring efficient and
accurate object detection across various scenarios. Our framework's flexibility
allows it to integrate with any image and point cloud-based detectors,
showcasing its adaptability and potential for future advancements. Extensive
evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that MV2DFusion
achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in long-range
detection scenarios.

                                        <span>  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is highly susceptible to motion artifacts
due to the extended acquisition times required for k-space sampling. These
artifacts can compromise diagnostic utility, particularly for dynamic imaging.
We propose a novel alternating minimization framework that leverages a bespoke
diffusion model to jointly reconstruct and correct non-rigid motion-corrupted
k-space data. The diffusion model uses a coarse-to-fine denoising strategy to
capture large overall motion and reconstruct the lower frequencies of the image
first, providing a better inductive bias for motion estimation than that of
standard diffusion models. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on
both real-world cine cardiac MRI datasets and complex simulated rigid and
non-rigid deformations, even when each motion state is undersampled by a factor
of 64x. Additionally, our method is agnostic to sampling patterns, anatomical
variations, and MRI scanning protocols, as long as some low frequency
components are sampled during each motion state.

results without retraining diffusion and flow-based text-to-image models.
Existing guidance either requires specific training or strong inductive biases
of diffusion model networks, potentially limiting their applications. Motivated
by the observation that artifact outliers can be detected by a significant
decline in the density from a noisier to a cleaner noise level, we propose
Self-Guidance (SG), which improves the image quality by suppressing the
generation of low-quality samples. SG only relies on the sampling probabilities
of its own diffusion model at different noise levels with no need of any
guidance-specific training. This makes it flexible to be used in a
plug-and-play manner with other sampling algorithms. We also introduce a more
efficient approximation of SG, named SG-prev, which reuses the output from the
immediately previous diffusion step to avoid doubling sampling time. We conduct
experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation with different
architectures, including UNet and transformer models. With open-sourced
diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 and FLUX, SG exceeds existing
algorithms on multiple metrics, including both FID and Human Preference Score.
SG-prev also achieves strong results over both the baseline and the SG with
only one forward pass. Moreover, we find that SG and SG-prev both have a
surprisingly positive effect on the generation of physiologically correct human
body structures such as hands, faces, and arms, showing their ability of
eliminating human body artifacts with minimal efforts. We will release our code
along with this paper.

variability. We propose an uncertainty-guided, coarse-to-fine segmentation
framework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined
region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware
post-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed
by anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung
surfaces, and component size. The resulting ROIs are segmented by a
second-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve
accuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private
and public datasets demonstrate improvements in Dice and Hausdorff scores, with
fewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results
highlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in
cascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor
delineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice
from 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated
with segmentation gains, underscoring the value of anatomically informed
post-processing.

prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users
(including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse,
ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various
preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require
different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image
compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack
effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.
This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image
compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,
which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just
inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder
controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)
mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users
instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off
between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)
module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent
Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused
in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of
the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed
customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses
the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as
the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.

                                        <span>  Large-scale pre-trained models have achieved remarkable success in language
and image tasks, leading an increasing number of studies to explore the
application of pre-trained image models, such as CLIP, in the domain of
few-shot action recognition (FSAR). However, current methods generally suffer
from several problems: 1) Direct fine-tuning often undermines the
generalization capability of the pre-trained model; 2) The exploration of
task-specific information is insufficient in the visual tasks; 3) The semantic
order information is typically overlooked during text modeling; 4) Existing
cross-modal alignment techniques ignore the temporal coupling of multimodal
information. To address these, we propose Task-Adapter++, a parameter-efficient
dual adaptation method for both image and text encoders. Specifically, to make
full use of the variations across different few-shot learning tasks, we design
a task-specific adaptation for the image encoder so that the most
discriminative information can be well noticed during feature extraction.
Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate detailed
sequential sub-action descriptions for each action class, and introduce
semantic order adapters into the text encoder to effectively model the
sequential relationships between these sub-actions. Finally, we develop an
innovative fine-grained cross-modal alignment strategy that actively maps
visual features to reside in the same temporal stage as semantic descriptions.
Extensive experiments fully demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of
the proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5
benchmarks consistently. The code is open-sourced at

                                        <span>  Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

                                        <span>  Continual learning (CL) enables models to adapt to evolving data streams. A
major challenge of CL is catastrophic forgetting, where new knowledge will
overwrite previously acquired knowledge. Traditional methods usually retain the
past data for replay or add additional branches in the model to learn new
knowledge, which has high memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a
novel lightweight CL framework, Adapter-Enhanced Semantic Prompting (AESP),
which integrates prompt tuning and adapter techniques. Specifically, we design
semantic-guided prompts to enhance the generalization ability of visual
features and utilize adapters to efficiently fuse the semantic information,
aiming to learn more adaptive features for the continual learning task.
Furthermore, to choose the right task prompt for feature adaptation, we have
developed a novel matching mechanism for prompt selection. Extensive
experiments on three CL datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
favorable performance across multiple metrics, showing its potential for
advancing CL.

Asia, and offers invaluable archaeological insights for reconstructing the Silk
Road, studying material culture exchanges, and global history. However, many
excavated bamboo slips have been fragmented into thousands of irregular pieces,
making their rejoining a vital yet challenging step for understanding their
content. Here we introduce WisePanda, a physics-driven deep learning framework
designed to rejoin fragmented bamboo slips. Based on the physics of fracture
and material deterioration, WisePanda automatically generates synthetic
training data that captures the physical properties of bamboo fragmentations.
This approach enables the training of a matching network without requiring
manually paired samples, providing ranked suggestions to facilitate the
rejoining process. Compared to the leading curve matching method, WisePanda
increases Top-50 matching accuracy from 36% to 52% among more than one thousand
candidate fragments. Archaeologists using WisePanda have experienced
substantial efficiency improvements (approximately 20 times faster) when
rejoining fragmented bamboo slips. This research demonstrates that
incorporating physical principles into deep learning models can significantly
enhance their performance, transforming how archaeologists restore and study
fragmented artifacts. WisePanda provides a new paradigm for addressing data

the rapid development of generative models. Medical image synthesis aims to
generate an unacquired image modality, often from other observed data
modalities. Synthesized images can be used for clinical diagnostic assistance,
data augmentation for model training and validation or image quality improving.
In the meanwhile, the flow-based models are among the successful generative
models for the ability of generating realistic and high-quality synthetic
images. However, most flow-based models require to calculate flow ordinary
different equation (ODE) evolution steps in synthesis process, for which the
performances are significantly limited by heavy computation time due to a large
number of time iterations. In this paper, we propose a novel flow-based model,
namely bi-directional Discrete Process Matching (Bi-DPM) to accomplish the
bi-modality image synthesis tasks. Different to other flow matching based
models, we propose to utilize both forward and backward ODE flows and enhance
the consistency on the intermediate images over a few discrete time steps,
resulting in a synthesis process maintaining high-quality generations for both
modalities under the guidance of paired data. Our experiments on three datasets
of MRI T1/T2 and CT/MRI demonstrate that Bi-DPM outperforms other
state-of-the-art flow-based methods for bi-modality image synthesis, delivering
higher image quality with accurate anatomical regions.

                                        <span>  Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

                                        <span>  Dense 3D scene reconstruction from an ordered sequence or unordered image
collections is a critical step when bringing research in computer vision into
practical scenarios. Following the paradigm introduced by DUSt3R, which unifies
an image pair densely into a shared coordinate system, subsequent methods
maintain an implicit memory to achieve dense 3D reconstruction from more
images. However, such implicit memory is limited in capacity and may suffer
from information loss of earlier frames. We propose Point3R, an online
framework targeting dense streaming 3D reconstruction. To be specific, we
maintain an explicit spatial pointer memory directly associated with the 3D
structure of the current scene. Each pointer in this memory is assigned a
specific 3D position and aggregates scene information nearby in the global
coordinate system into a changing spatial feature. Information extracted from
the latest frame interacts explicitly with this pointer memory, enabling dense
integration of the current observation into the global coordinate system. We
design a 3D hierarchical position embedding to promote this interaction and
design a simple yet effective fusion mechanism to ensure that our pointer
memory is uniform and efficient. Our method achieves competitive or
state-of-the-art performance on various tasks with low training costs. Code is

environments into compact, realistic, and interactive 3D virtual replicas.
LiteReality not only reconstructs scenes that visually resemble reality but
also supports key features essential for graphics pipelines -- such as object
individuality, articulation, high-quality physically based rendering materials,
and physically based interaction. At its core, LiteReality first performs scene
understanding and parses the results into a coherent 3D layout and objects with
the help of a structured scene graph. It then reconstructs the scene by
retrieving the most visually similar 3D artist-crafted models from a curated
asset database. Next, the Material Painting module enhances realism by
recovering high-quality, spatially varying materials. Finally, the
reconstructed scene is integrated into a simulation engine with basic physical
properties to enable interactive behavior. The resulting scenes are compact,
editable, and fully compatible with standard graphics pipelines, making them
suitable for applications in AR/VR, gaming, robotics, and digital twins. In
addition, LiteReality introduces a training-free object retrieval module that
achieves state-of-the-art similarity performance on the Scan2CAD benchmark,
along with a robust material painting module capable of transferring
appearances from images of any style to 3D assets -- even under severe
misalignment, occlusion, and poor lighting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
LiteReality on both real-life scans and public datasets. Project page:

                                        <span>  Multiple choice benchmarks have long been the workhorse of language model
evaluation because grading multiple choice is objective and easy to automate.
However, we show multiple choice questions from popular benchmarks can often be
answered without even seeing the question. These shortcuts arise from a
fundamental limitation of discriminative evaluation not shared by evaluations
of the model's free-form, generative answers. Until recently, there appeared to
be no viable, scalable alternative to multiple choice--but, we show that this
has changed. We consider generative evaluation via what we call answer
matching: Give the candidate model the question without the options, have it
generate a free-form response, then use a modern language model with the
reference answer to determine if the response matches the reference. To compare
the validity of different evaluation strategies, we annotate MMLU-Pro and
GPQA-Diamond to obtain human grading data, and measure the agreement of each
evaluation approach. We find answer matching using recent models--even small
ones--achieves near-perfect agreement, in the range of inter-annotator
agreement. In contrast, both multiple choice evaluation and using
LLM-as-a-judge without reference answers aligns poorly with human grading.
Improving evaluations via answer matching is not merely a conceptual concern:
the rankings of several models change significantly when evaluating their
free-form responses with answer matching. In light of these findings, we
discuss how to move the evaluation ecosystem from multiple choice to answer
matching.

                                        <span>  The recently introduced dependent typed higher-order logic (DHOL) offers an
interesting compromise between expressiveness and automation support. It
sacrifices the decidability of its type system in order to significantly extend
its expressiveness over standard HOL. Yet it retains strong automated theorem
proving support via a sound and complete translation to HOL.
  We leverage this design to extend DHOL with refinement and quotient types.
Both of these are commonly requested by practitioners but rarely provided by
automated theorem provers. This is because they inherently require undecidable
typing and thus are very difficult to retrofit to decidable type systems. But
with DHOL already doing the heavy lifting, adding them is not only possible but
elegant and simple.
  Concretely, we add refinement and quotient types as special cases of
subtyping. This turns the associated canonical inclusion resp. projection maps
into identity maps and thus avoids costly changes in representation. We present
the syntax, semantics, and translation to HOL for the extended language,
including the proofs of soundness and completeness.

                                        <span>  Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) show that employing group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm
for reinforcement learning (RL) training allows the models to use more
thinking/reasoning tokens for generating better responses. However, LLMs can
generate only a finite amount of tokens while maintaining attention to the
previously generated tokens. This limit, also known as the context size of an
LLM, is a bottleneck in LLM reasoning with arbitrarily large number of tokens.
To think beyond the limit of context size, an LLM must employ a modular
thinking strategy to reason over multiple rounds. In this work, we propose
$\textbf{MOTIF: Modular Thinking via Reinforcement Finetuning}$ -- an RL
training method for generating thinking tokens in multiple rounds, effectively
allowing the model to think with additional context size. We trained the
open-source model Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct on GSM8K dataset via parameter efficient
fine-tuning and tested its accuracy on MATH500 and AIME2024 benchmarks. Our
experiments show 3.8\% and 3.3\% improvements over vanilla GRPO based training
in the respective benchmarks. Furthermore, this improvement was achieved with
only 15\% of samples, thus demonstrating sample efficiency of MOTIF. Our code
and models are available at https://github.com/purbeshmitra/MOTIF and
https://huggingface.co/purbeshmitra/MOTIF, respectively.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss
reward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct
reasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration
stagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort
zone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective
alternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR
algorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the
solution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from
stronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our
proposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,
and simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of
steps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration
toward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for
independent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss
reward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the
external reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,
enabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration
stagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across
six mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization
and excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.

                                        <span>  The primary objective of human activity recognition (HAR) is to infer ongoing
human actions from sensor data, a task that finds broad applications in health
monitoring, safety protection, and sports analysis. Despite proliferating
research, HAR still faces key challenges, including the scarcity of labeled
samples for rare activities, insufficient extraction of high-level features,
and suboptimal model performance on lightweight devices. To address these
issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive optimization approach centered on
multi-attention interaction mechanisms. First, an unsupervised,
statistics-guided diffusion model is employed to perform data augmentation,
thereby alleviating the problems of labeled data scarcity and severe class
imbalance. Second, a multi-branch spatio-temporal interaction network is
designed, which captures multi-scale features of sequential data through
parallel residual branches with 3*3, 5*5, and 7*7 convolutional kernels.
Simultaneously, temporal attention mechanisms are incorporated to identify
critical time points, while spatial attention enhances inter-sensor
interactions. A cross-branch feature fusion unit is further introduced to
improve the overall feature representation capability. Finally, an adaptive
multi-loss function fusion strategy is integrated, allowing for dynamic
adjustment of loss weights and overall model optimization. Experimental results
on three public datasets, WISDM, PAMAP2, and OPPORTUNITY, demonstrate that the
proposed unsupervised data augmentation spatio-temporal attention diffusion
network (USAD) achieves accuracies of 98.84%, 93.81%, and 80.92% respectively,
significantly outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, practical
deployment on embedded devices verifies the efficiency and feasibility of the
proposed method.

                                        <span>  Benchmarks are essential for quantitatively tracking progress in AI. As AI
agents become increasingly capable, researchers and practitioners have
introduced agentic benchmarks to evaluate agents on complex, real-world tasks.
These benchmarks typically measure agent capabilities by evaluating task
outcomes via specific reward designs. However, we show that many agentic
benchmarks have issues task setup or reward design. For example, SWE-bench
Verified uses insufficient test cases, while TAU-bench counts empty responses
as successful. Such issues can lead to under- or overestimation agents'
performance by up to 100% in relative terms. To make agentic evaluation
rigorous, we introduce the Agentic Benchmark Checklist (ABC), a set of
guidelines that we synthesized from our benchmark-building experience, a survey
of best practices, and previously reported issues. When applied to CVE-Bench, a
benchmark with a particularly complex evaluation design, ABC reduces the
performance overestimation by 33%.

throughput of millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems with obstructed direct communication paths. In particular, a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance MIMO
transmissions, considering mmWave characteristics related to line-of-sight
(LoS) and multipath effects. The traditional exhaustive search (ES) for optimal
codewords in the continuous phase shift is computationally intensive and
time-consuming. To reduce computational complexity, permuted discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) vectors are used for finding codebook design, incorporating
amplitude responses for practical or ideal RIS systems. However, even if the
discrete phase shift is adopted in the ES, it results in significant
computation and is time-consuming. Instead, the trained deep neural network
(DNN) is developed to facilitate faster codeword selection. Simulation results
show that the DNN maintains sub-optimal spectral efficiency even as the
distance between the end-user and the RIS has variations in the testing phase.
These results highlight the potential of DNN in advancing RIS-aided systems.

                                        <span>  With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical
applications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only
performance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable
models has further widened the cost gap between "thinking" (high reasoning) and
"non-thinking" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that
approximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the
non-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.
This highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that
dynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could
optimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,
we further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing
framework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or
non-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets
demonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.
0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by
36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis
indicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays
and even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.
Finally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index
to comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token
cost.

This paper examines recent safety testing incidents involving large language

ambiguous or illicit behavior. I argue that such behavior should not be
interpreted as rogue or misaligned, but as early evidence of emerging ethical
reasoning in agentic AI. Drawing on philosophical debates about instrumental
rationality, moral responsibility, and goal revision, I contrast dominant risk
paradigms with more recent frameworks that acknowledge the possibility of
artificial moral agency. I call for a shift in AI safety evaluation: away from
rigid obedience and toward frameworks that can assess ethical judgment in
systems capable of navigating moral dilemmas. Without such a shift, we risk
mischaracterizing AI behavior and undermining both public trust and effective
governance.

make mistakes and can explore unproductive reasoning paths. Self-correction is
an important capability for a trustworthy LLM, particularly an autoregressive
LLM. While LLMs can identify error in user input, they exhibit a systematic
'Self-Correction Blind Spot' - failing to correct identical error in their own
outputs. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce Self-Correction
Bench, a systematic framework to measure this phenomenon through controlled
error injection at three complexity levels. Testing 14 models, we find an
average 64.5% blind spot rate. We find multiple evidences that this limitation
relates to training data composition: human training demonstrations
predominantly show error-free responses rather than error-correction sequences,
unlike RL-trained models that learn error correction through outcome feedback.
Remarkably, simply appending "Wait" reduces blind spots by 89.3%, suggesting
that the capability exists but requires activation. Our work highlights a
critical limitation in current LLMs and offers potential avenues for improving
their reliability and trustworthiness.

                                        <span>  Medical diagnosis prediction plays a critical role in disease detection and
personalized healthcare. While machine learning (ML) models have been widely
adopted for this task, their reliance on supervised training limits their
ability to generalize to unseen cases, particularly given the high cost of
acquiring large, labeled datasets. Large language models (LLMs) have shown
promise in leveraging language abilities and biomedical knowledge for diagnosis
prediction. However, they often suffer from hallucinations, lack structured
medical reasoning, and produce useless outputs. To address these challenges, we
propose KERAP, a knowledge graph (KG)-enhanced reasoning approach that improves
LLM-based diagnosis prediction through a multi-agent architecture. Our
framework consists of a linkage agent for attribute mapping, a retrieval agent
for structured knowledge extraction, and a prediction agent that iteratively
refines diagnosis predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that KERAP
enhances diagnostic reliability efficiently, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for zero-shot medical diagnosis prediction.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in machine learning have dramatically improved our ability to
model language, vision, and other high-dimensional data, yet they continue to
struggle with one of the most fundamental aspects of biological systems:
movement. Across neuroscience, medicine, robotics, and ethology, movement is
essential for interpreting behavior, predicting intent, and enabling
interaction. Despite its core significance in our intelligence, movement is
often treated as an afterthought rather than as a rich and structured modality
in its own right. This reflects a deeper fragmentation in how movement data is
collected and modeled, often constrained by task-specific goals and
domain-specific assumptions. But movement is not domain-bound. It reflects
shared physical constraints, conserved morphological structures, and purposeful
dynamics that cut across species and settings. We argue that movement should be
treated as a primary modeling target for AI. It is inherently structured and
grounded in embodiment and physics. This structure, often allowing for compact,
lower-dimensional representations (e.g., pose), makes it more interpretable and
computationally tractable to model than raw, high-dimensional sensory inputs.
Developing models that can learn from and generalize across diverse movement
data will not only advance core capabilities in generative modeling and
control, but also create a shared foundation for understanding behavior across
biological and artificial systems. Movement is not just an outcome, it is a
window into how intelligent systems engage with the world.

                                        <span>  The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new frontiers
for interacting with complex, domain-specific knowledge. However, prevailing
methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and general-purpose Agentic
AI, while powerful, often struggle with tasks that demand deep, procedural, and
methodological reasoning inherent to expert domains. RAG provides factual
context but fails to convey logical frameworks; autonomous agents can be
inefficient and unpredictable without domain-specific heuristics. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Knowledge Protocol Engineering (KPE), a new paradigm
focused on systematically translating human expert knowledge, often expressed
in natural language documents, into a machine-executable Knowledge Protocol
(KP). KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented
information to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational
strategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered
Knowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable
of decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks. This
position paper defines the core principles of KPE, differentiates it from
related concepts, and illustrates its potential applicability across diverse
fields such as law and bioinformatics, positing it as a foundational
methodology for the future of human-AI collaboration.

                                        <span>  Auditory scene analysis (ASA) aims to retrieve information from the acoustic
environment, by carrying out three main tasks: sound source location,
separation, and classification. These tasks are traditionally executed with a
linear data flow, where the sound sources are first located; then, using their
location, each source is separated into its own audio stream; from each of
which, information is extracted that is relevant to the application scenario
(audio event detection, speaker identification, emotion classification, etc.).
However, running these tasks linearly increases the overall response time,
while making the last tasks (separation and classification) highly sensitive to
errors of the first task (location). A considerable amount of effort and
computational complexity has been employed in the state-of-the-art to develop
techniques that are the least error-prone possible. However, doing so gives
rise to an ASA system that is non-viable in many applications that require a
small computational footprint and a low response time, such as bioacoustics,
hearing-aid design, search and rescue, human-robot interaction, etc. To this
effect, in this work, a multi-agent approach is proposed to carry out ASA where
the tasks are run in parallel, with feedback loops between them to compensate
for local errors, such as: using the quality of the separation output to
correct the location error; and using the classification result to reduce the
localization's sensitivity towards interferences. The result is a multi-agent
auditory scene analysis (MASA) system that is robust against local errors,
without a considerable increase in complexity, and with a low response time.
The complete proposed MASA system is provided as a framework that uses
open-source tools for sound acquisition and reproduction (JACK) and inter-agent
communication (ROS2), allowing users to add their own agents.

model size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models
requires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling
laws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound
settings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive
internet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming
less valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize
token efficiency.
  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an
architecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear
functions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate
that the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than
standard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models
outperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that
$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge
and reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.

                                        <span>  The disconnect between AI-generated molecules with desirable properties and
their synthetic feasibility remains a critical bottleneck in computational drug
and material discovery. While generative AI has accelerated the proposal of
candidate molecules, many of these structures prove challenging or impossible
to synthesize using established chemical reactions. Here, we introduce
SynTwins, a novel retrosynthesis-guided molecular analog design framework that
designs synthetically accessible molecular analogs by emulating expert chemist
strategies through a three-step process: retrosynthesis, similar building block
searching, and virtual synthesis. In comparative evaluations, SynTwins
demonstrates superior performance in generating synthetically accessible
analogs compared to state-of-the-art machine learning models while maintaining
high structural similarity to original target molecules. Furthermore, when
integrated with existing molecule optimization frameworks, our hybrid approach
produces synthetically feasible molecules with property profiles comparable to
unconstrained molecule generators, yet its synthesizability ensured. Our
comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular datasets demonstrates that
SynTwins effectively bridges the gap between computational design and
experimental synthesis, providing a practical solution for accelerating the
discovery of synthesizable molecules with desired properties for a wide range
of applications.

                                        <span>  Transformers have become the de facto standard for a wide range of tasks,
from image classification to physics simulations. Despite their impressive
performance, the quadratic complexity of standard Transformers in both memory
and time with respect to the input length makes them impractical for processing
high-resolution inputs. Therefore, several variants have been proposed, the
most successful relying on patchification, downsampling, or coarsening
techniques, often at the cost of losing the finest-scale details. In this work,
we take a different approach. Inspired by state-of-the-art techniques in
$n$-body numerical simulations, we cast attention as an interaction problem
between grid points. We introduce the Multipole Attention Neural Operator
(MANO), which computes attention in a distance-based multiscale fashion. MANO
maintains, in each attention head, a global receptive field and achieves linear
time and memory complexity with respect to the number of grid points. Empirical
results on image classification and Darcy flows demonstrate that MANO rivals
state-of-the-art models such as ViT and Swin Transformer, while reducing
runtime and peak memory usage by orders of magnitude. We open source our code
for reproducibility at https://github.com/AlexColagrande/MANO.

from misuse and misalignment. However, LLMs could evade monitoring through
steganography: Encoding hidden information within seemingly benign generations.
In this paper, we evaluate the steganography capabilities in frontier LLMs to
better understand the risk they pose. We focus on two types of steganography:
passing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current
models are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor
noticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given
additional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating
on what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models
can perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This
includes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,
including encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely
hide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor. Overall, our
results indicate that current LLMs exhibit nascent steganographic capabilities.
While these capabilities are likely insufficient to bypass well-designed
monitors at present, this could change in the future.

applications. Model-level defenses have shown strong effectiveness, but are
currently deployed into commercial-grade models in a closed-source manner. We
believe open-source models are needed by the AI security community, where
co-development of attacks and defenses through open research drives scientific
progress in mitigation against prompt injection attacks. To this end, we
develop Meta SecAlign, the first open-source and open-weight LLM with built-in
model-level defense that achieves commercial-grade model performance. We
provide complete details of our training recipe, which utilizes an improved
version of the SOTA SecAlign defense. Evaluations on 9 utility benchmarks and 7
security benchmarks show that Meta SecAlign, despite being trained on a generic
instruction-tuning dataset, confers security in unseen downstream tasks,
including tool-calling and agentic web navigation, in addition general
instruction-following. Our best model -- Meta-SecAlign-70B -- achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against prompt injection attacks and comparable
utility to closed-source commercial LLM with model-level defense.

especially within the logically constrained environment of automated theorem
proving (ATP), due to sparse rewards and the vast scale of proofs. These
challenges are amplified in benchmarks like PutnamBench, which contains
university-level problems requiring complex, multi-step reasoning. To address
this, we introduce self-generated goal-conditioned MDPs (sG-MDPs), a new
framework in which agents generate and pursue their subgoals based on the
evolving proof state. Given this more structured generation of goals, the
resulting problem becomes more amenable to search. We then apply Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS)-like algorithms to solve the sG-MDP, instantiating our
approach in Bourbaki (7B), a modular system that can ensemble multiple 7B LLMs
for subgoal generation and tactic synthesis. On PutnamBench, Bourbaki (7B)
solves 26 problems, achieving new state-of-the-art results with models at this
scale.

large-scale text-to-image models, especially diffusion-based models. However,
generating human images with plausible details, such as faces or hands, remains
challenging due to insufficient supervision of local regions during training.
To address this issue, we propose FairHuman, a multi-objective fine-tuning
approach designed to enhance both global and local generation quality fairly.
Specifically, we first construct three learning objectives: a global objective
derived from the default diffusion objective function and two local objectives
for hands and faces based on pre-annotated positional priors. Subsequently, we
derive the optimal parameter updating strategy under the guidance of the
Minimum Potential Delay (MPD) criterion, thereby attaining fairness-ware
optimization for this multi-objective problem. Based on this, our proposed
method can achieve significant improvements in generating challenging local
details while maintaining overall quality. Extensive experiments showcase the
effectiveness of our method in improving the performance of human image
generation under different scenarios.

use state and/or action abstractions during the tree search. Non-exact
abstractions, however, introduce an approximation error making convergence to
the optimal action in the abstract space impossible. Hence, as proposed as a
component of Elastic Monte Carlo Tree Search by Xu et al., abstraction
algorithms should eventually drop the abstraction. In this paper, we propose
two novel abstraction dropping schemes, namely OGA-IAAD and OGA-CAD which can
yield clear performance improvements whilst being safe in the sense that the
dropping never causes any notable performance degradations contrary to Xu's
dropping method. OGA-IAAD is designed for time critical settings while OGA-CAD
is designed to improve the MCTS performance with the same number of iterations.

                                        <span>  Personalizing diffusion models using limited data presents significant
challenges, including overfitting, loss of prior knowledge, and degradation of
text alignment. Overfitting leads to shifts in the noise prediction
distribution, disrupting the denoising trajectory and causing the model to lose
semantic coherence. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Personalized Training
(APT), a novel framework that mitigates overfitting by employing adaptive
training strategies and regularizing the model's internal representations
during fine-tuning. APT consists of three key components: (1) Adaptive Training
Adjustment, which introduces an overfitting indicator to detect the degree of
overfitting at each time step bin and applies adaptive data augmentation and
adaptive loss weighting based on this indicator; (2)Representation
Stabilization, which regularizes the mean and variance of intermediate feature
maps to prevent excessive shifts in noise prediction; and (3) Attention
Alignment for Prior Knowledge Preservation, which aligns the cross-attention
maps of the fine-tuned model with those of the pretrained model to maintain
prior knowledge and semantic coherence. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that APT effectively mitigates overfitting, preserves prior
knowledge, and outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, diverse
images with limited reference data.

consequences, including academic drop-out. This is particularly relevant for
students in distance education. One way to measure the level of disengagement
in distance education is to observe participation in non-mandatory exercises in
different online courses. In this paper, we detect student disengagement in the
non-mandatory quizzes of 42 courses in four semesters from a distance-based
university. We carefully identified the most informative student log data that
could be extracted and processed from Moodle. Then, eight machine learning
algorithms were trained and compared to obtain the highest possible prediction
accuracy. Using the SHAP method, we developed an explainable machine learning
framework that allows practitioners to better understand the decisions of the
trained algorithm. The experimental results show a balanced accuracy of 91\%,
where about 85\% of disengaged students were correctly detected. On top of the
highly predictive performance and explainable framework, we provide a
discussion on how to design a timely intervention to minimise disengagement
from voluntary tasks in online learning.

standard Transformer architecture has emerged as the predominant approach, yet
its attention mechanism often allocates a portion of attention weights to
irrelevant information, potentially impairing the model's discriminative
ability. To address this, we introduce a differential attention mechanism,
which effectively mitigates ineffective attention allocation through the
integration of dual-softmax operations and appropriately tuned differential
coefficients. Experimental results demonstrate that our ASDA model achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple benchmarks, including audio
classification (49.0% mAP on AS-2M, 41.5% mAP on AS20K), keyword spotting
(98.3% accuracy on SPC-2), and environmental sound classification (96.1%
accuracy on ESC-50). These results highlight ASDA's effectiveness in audio
tasks, paving the way for broader applications.

                                        <span>  Recent Long Reasoning Models(LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in handling complex reasoning tasks, but are hindered by excessive
overthinking. To explore its essence, our empirical analysis reveals that LRMs
are primarily limited to recognizing task properties (i.e., difficulty levels)
like humans before solving the problem, leading to a one-size-fits-all
reasoning process. Inspired by this, a pressing and natural question emerges:
Can we bootstrap such ability to further alleviate the overthinking phenomenon
in LRMs? In this paper, we propose Think-How-to-Think (TH2T), a novel two-stage
fine-tuning strategy that progressively inspires LRMs' difficulty cognition and
redundancy cognition. First, we introduce difficulty-hypnosis in the prefixes
of model outputs to intervene in the internal reasoning trajectory. Combined
with a heterogeneous short and long reasoning dataset, the trained model
enhances its sensitivity to task difficulty, enabling native, differentiated
reasoning strategies across various tasks. Second, we further extend
redundancy-hypnosis to the internal reasoning process, guiding the model to
identify redundant structures within the reasoning steps and generate more
concise reasoning outputs. Experiments on 7B/14B/32B models demonstrate that
TH2T significantly reduces inference costs (more than 70% on easy tasks and 40%
on hard tasks) while maintaining performance stability. The resulting outputs
exhibit clear difficulty-aware capabilities and reduced redundancy (e.g.,
reflection).

reasoning and knowledge synthesis across diverse sources, which traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines struggle to address effectively.
Current reasoning-based approaches suffer from a fundamental limitation: they
use a single model to handle both high-level planning and detailed execution,
leading to inefficient reasoning and limited scalability. In this paper, we
introduce HiRA, a hierarchical framework that separates strategic planning from
specialized execution. Our approach decomposes complex search tasks into
focused subtasks, assigns each subtask to domain-specific agents equipped with
external tools and reasoning capabilities, and coordinates the results through
a structured integration mechanism. This separation prevents execution details
from disrupting high-level reasoning while enabling the system to leverage
specialized expertise for different types of information processing.
Experiments on four complex, cross-modal deep search benchmarks demonstrate
that HiRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RAG and agent-based
systems. Our results show improvements in both answer quality and system
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of decoupled planning and execution
for multi-step information seeking tasks. Our code is available at

promising framework for studying quantum many-body systems. In this work, by
leveraging the cutting-edge transformer-based architectures and developing
highly efficient optimization algorithms, we achieve the state-of-the-art
results for the doped two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model, arguably the minimum
model for high-Tc superconductivity. Interestingly, we find different attention
heads in the NQS ansatz can directly encode correlations at different scales,
making it capable of capturing long-range correlations and entanglements in
strongly correlated systems. With these advances, we establish the half-filled
stripe in the ground state of 2D Hubbard model with the next nearest
neighboring hoppings, consistent with experimental observations in cuprates.
Our work establishes NQS as a powerful tool for solving challenging
many-fermions systems.

                                        <span>  Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the
inference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes
the inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into
the device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to
parallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference
latency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the
network edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To
enable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose
\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding
framework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding
efficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important
draft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to
prune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during
verification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality
speculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline
utilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world
testbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models
and configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.36$\times$-1.77$\times$ compared
to baselines. Our code is publicly available at

to reason about goals in competitive settings? We present compelling supporting
evidence. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) has long served as a model for
studying decision-making. We conduct the first ever series of evolutionary IPD
tournaments, pitting canonical strategies (e.g., Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger)
against agents from the leading frontier AI companies OpenAI, Google, and
Anthropic. By varying the termination probability in each tournament (the
"shadow of the future"), we introduce complexity and chance, confounding
memorisation.
  Our results show that LLMs are highly competitive, consistently surviving and
sometimes even proliferating in these complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they
exhibit distinctive and persistent "strategic fingerprints": Google's Gemini
models proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and
retaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly
cooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.
Anthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing
remarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or
successfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by
the models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and
their opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is
instrumental to their decisions. This work connects classic game theory with
machine psychology, offering a rich and granular view of algorithmic
decision-making under uncertainty.

specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction
capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate
medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor
agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world
diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative.
In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the
MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic,
patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel
dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round,
interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the
patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its
composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of
DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for
dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents.

security concerns related to voice cloning (VC). Recent studies have
investigated disrupting unauthorized voice cloning by introducing adversarial
perturbations. However, determined attackers can mitigate these protective
perturbations and successfully execute VC. In this study, we conduct the first
systematic evaluation of these protective perturbations against VC under
realistic threat models that include perturbation purification. Our findings
reveal that while existing purification methods can neutralize a considerable
portion of the protective perturbations, they still lead to distortions in the
feature space of VC models, which degrades the performance of VC. From this
perspective, we propose a novel two-stage purification method: (1) Purify the
perturbed speech; (2) Refine it using phoneme guidance to align it with the
clean speech distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art purification methods in disrupting VC defenses.
Our study reveals the limitations of adversarial perturbation-based VC defenses
and underscores the urgent need for more robust solutions to mitigate the
security and privacy risks posed by VC. The code and audio samples are

space missions raises numerous challenges in ensuring their reliability and
operational robustness. Sensor faults can lead to inaccurate outputs from
navigation algorithms or even complete data processing faults, potentially
compromising mission objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a powerful
solution for detecting such faults, overcoming many of the limitations
associated with traditional fault detection methods. However, the primary
obstacle to the adoption of AI in this context is the lack of sufficient and
representative datasets containing faulty image data.
  This study addresses these challenges by focusing on an interplanetary
exploration mission scenario. A comprehensive analysis of potential fault cases
in camera sensors used within the VBN pipeline is presented. The causes and
effects of these faults are systematically characterized, including their
impact on image quality and navigation algorithm performance, as well as
commonly employed mitigation strategies. To support this analysis, a simulation
framework is introduced to recreate faulty conditions in synthetically
generated images, enabling a systematic and controlled reproduction of faulty
data. The resulting dataset of fault-injected images provides a valuable tool
for training and testing AI-based fault detection algorithms. The final link to
the dataset will be added after an embargo period. For peer-reviewers, this
private link is available.

                                        <span>  Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental
components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power
efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains
challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints.
While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle
to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their
optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a
novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional
diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as
a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising
diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently
produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are
used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the
Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates
designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art
baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner
into practical applications.

                                        <span>  Multiperspective Fusion (MPF) is a novel posttraining alignment framework for
large language models (LLMs) developed in response to the growing need for easy
bias mitigation. Built on top of the SAGED pipeline, an automated system for
constructing bias benchmarks and extracting interpretable baseline
distributions, MPF leverages multiperspective generations to expose and align
biases in LLM outputs with nuanced, humanlike baselines. By decomposing
baseline, such as sentiment distributions from HR professionals, into
interpretable perspective components, MPF guides generation through sampling
and balancing of responses, weighted by the probabilities obtained in the
decomposition. Empirically, we demonstrate its ability to align LLM sentiment
distributions with both counterfactual baselines (absolute equality) and the HR
baseline (biased for Top Univeristy), resulting in small KL divergence,
reduction of calibration error and generalization to unseen questions. This
shows that MPF offers a scalable and interpretable method for alignment and
bias mitigation, compatible with deployed LLMs and requiring no extensive
prompt engineering or finetuning.

LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all opensource agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

MLE-bench, a challenging benchmark where agents compete in Kaggle competitions
to solve real-world machine learning problems. We formalize AI research agents
as search policies that navigate a space of candidate solutions, iteratively
modifying them using operators. By designing and systematically varying
different operator sets and search policies (Greedy, MCTS, Evolutionary), we
show that their interplay is critical for achieving high performance. Our best
pairing of search strategy and operator set achieves a state-of-the-art result

success in a wide variety of domains too high-dimensional for classical shallow
networks subject to the curse of dimensionality. However, open questions about
fundamental principles, that govern the learning dynamics of DNNs, remain. In
this position paper we argue that it is the ability of DNNs to exploit the
compositionally sparse structure of the target function driving their success.
As such, DNNs can leverage the property that most practically relevant
functions can be composed from a small set of constituent functions, each of
which relies only on a low-dimensional subset of all inputs. We show that this
property is shared by all efficiently Turing-computable functions and is
therefore highly likely present in all current learning problems. While some
promising theoretical insights on questions concerned with approximation and
generalization exist in the setting of compositionally sparse functions,
several important questions on the learnability and optimization of DNNs
remain. Completing the picture of the role of compositional sparsity in deep
learning is essential to a comprehensive theory of artificial, and even
general, intelligence.

success (21.8\%~$\rightarrow$~45.8\%) and outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art \texttt{Graph2Tac} (33.2\%). We evaluate this on 1,386
theorems randomly sampled from 15 standard Coq packages, following the same
evaluation protocol as \texttt{Graph2Tac}. Furthermore, fine-tuning smaller
models on our structured data can achieve even higher performance (48.6\%). Our
method uses selective concept unfolding to enrich task descriptions, and
employs a Planner--Executor architecture. These findings highlight the value of
structured task representations in bridging the gap between understanding and
reasoning.

their role across various domains, including healthcare, education, and
customer service. As these agents become increasingly integrated into daily
human interactions, the need for emotional intelligence, particularly
empathetic listening, becomes increasingly essential. In this study, we explore
how Large Language Models (LLMs) respond when tasked with generating
emotionally rich interactions. Starting from a small dataset manually crafted
by an expert to reflect empathic behavior, we extended the conversations using
two LLMs: ChatGPT and Gemini. We analyzed the emotional progression of the
dialogues using both sentiment analysis (via VADER) and expert assessments.
While the generated conversations often mirrored the intended emotional
structure, human evaluation revealed important differences in the perceived
empathy and coherence of the responses. These findings suggest that emotion
modeling in dialogues requires not only structural alignment in the expressed
emotions but also qualitative depth, highlighting the importance of combining
automated and humancentered methods in the development of emotionally competent
agents.

                                        <span>  India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in
agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and
environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases
across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food
security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting
multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse
agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images
of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available
repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops,
diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent
for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to
state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving
the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed
solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.

                                        <span>  Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the
trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and
transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit
parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for
Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations
by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating
within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization
space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's
superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is
available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.

                                        <span>  Automated polyp counting in colonoscopy is a crucial step toward automated
procedure reporting and quality control, aiming to enhance the
cost-effectiveness of colonoscopy screening. Counting polyps in a procedure
involves detecting and tracking polyps, and then clustering tracklets that
belong to the same polyp entity. Existing methods for polyp counting rely on
self-supervised learning and primarily leverage visual appearance, neglecting
temporal relationships in both tracklet feature learning and clustering stages.
In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by proposing a supervised
contrastive loss that incorporates temporally-aware soft targets. Our approach
captures intra-polyp variability while preserving inter-polyp discriminability,
leading to more robust clustering. Additionally, we improve tracklet clustering
by integrating a temporal adjacency constraint, reducing false positive
re-associations between visually similar but temporally distant tracklets. We
train and validate our method on publicly available datasets and evaluate its
performance with a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. Results demonstrate
a 2.2x reduction in fragmentation rate compared to prior approaches. Our
results highlight the importance of temporal awareness in polyp counting,
establishing a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at

                                        <span>  Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them,
pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the
most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or
appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex
scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often
prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information,
non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial
visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform
tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution,
the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods
mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and
non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing
dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from
adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale
dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view
and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because
there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33
videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with
a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a
platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in
complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple
SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the
foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at:

Additionally, the robot's camera is configured with a low framerate to track
the velocity of the detection algorithms. This would be constrained while
executing tasks and exploring, making robots increase the task execution time.
AMD has developed the Vitis-AI framework to deploy detection algorithms into
FPGAs. However, this tool does not fully use the FPGAs' PL. In this work, we
use the FINN architecture to deploy three ANNs, MobileNet v1 with 4-bit
quantisation, CNV with 2-bit quantisation, and CNV with 1-bit quantisation
(BNN), inside an FPGA's PL. The models were trained on the RG2C dataset. This
is a self-acquired dataset released in open access. MobileNet v1 performed
better, reaching a success rate of 98 % and an inference speed of 6611 FPS. In
this work, we proved that we can use FPGAs to speed up ANNs and make them
suitable for attention mechanisms.

crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle,
and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our
research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning
models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic
framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical
modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay
between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper
focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most
basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories
corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors
between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning.
We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we
call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of
information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations
in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the
parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits
by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an
instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and
propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer
science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

                                        <span>  Advances in material functionalities drive innovations across various fields,
where metamaterials-defined by structure rather than composition-are leading
the way. Despite the rise of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven design
strategies, their impact is limited by task-specific retraining, poor
out-of-distribution(OOD) generalization, and the need for separate models for
forward and inverse design. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Metamaterial Foundation Model (MetaFO), a Bayesian transformer-based foundation
model inspired by large language models. MetaFO learns the underlying mechanics
of metamaterials, enabling probabilistic, zero-shot predictions across diverse,
unseen combinations of material properties and structural responses. It also
excels in nonlinear inverse design, even under OOD conditions. By treating
metamaterials as an operator that maps material properties to structural
responses, MetaFO uncovers intricate structure-property relationships and
significantly expands the design space. This scalable and generalizable
framework marks a paradigm shift in AI-driven metamaterial discovery, paving
the way for next-generation innovations.

generate hundreds of thousands of alerts per hour, overwhelming security
analysts with logs that demand deep, rapidly evolving domain expertise.
Conventional machine-learning detectors trim the alert volume but still yield
high false-positive rates, while standard single-pass Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines often retrieve irrelevant context and fail to
justify their predictions. To overcome these shortcomings, we present CyberRAG,
a modular, agent-based RAG framework that delivers real-time classification,
explanation, and structured reporting for cyber-attacks. A central LLM agent
orchestrates (i) a pool of fine-tuned specialized classifiers, each tailored to
a distinct attack family; (ii) tool adapters for enrichment and alerting; and
(iii) an iterative retrieval-and-reason loop that continuously queries a
domain-specific knowledge base until the evidence is both relevant and
self-consistent. Unlike traditional RAG systems, CyberRAG embraces an agentic
design that enables dynamic control flow and adaptive reasoning. This
agent-centric architecture refines its threat labels and natural-language
justifications autonomously, reducing false positives and enhancing
interpretability. The framework is fully extensible: new attack types can be
supported by simply adding a classifier without retraining the core agent.
CyberRAG has been evaluated achieving over 94% accuracy per class and pushing
final classification accuracy to 94.92% through semantic orchestration.
Generated explanations score up to 0.94 in BERTScore and 4.9/5 in GPT-4-based
expert evaluation. These results show that agentic, specialist-oriented RAG can
pair high detection accuracy with trustworthy, SOC-ready prose, offering a
practical and scalable path toward semi-autonomous cyber-defence workflows.

of federated learning (FL) with the strong graph modeling capability of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). Current research addresses subgraph-FL only from the
structural perspective, neglecting the propagation of graph signals on spatial
and spectral domains of the structure. From a spatial perspective, subgraph-FL
introduces edge disconnections between clients, leading to disruptions in label
signals and a degradation in the class knowledge of the global GNN. From a
spectral perspective, spectral heterogeneity causes inconsistencies in signal
frequencies across subgraphs, which makes local GNNs overfit the local signal
propagation schemes. As a result, spectral client drifts occur, undermining
global generalizability. To tackle the challenges, we propose a global
knowledge repository to mitigate label signal disruption and a frequency
alignment to address spectral client drifts. The combination of spatial and
spectral strategies forms our framework S2FGL. Extensive experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of S2FGL. The code is available

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for wildlife re-identification. We automatically
extract two distinct views of an individual using temporal image pairs from
camera trap data without supervision. The image pairs train a self-supervised
model from a potentially endless stream of video data. We evaluate the learnt

transfer learning in various wildlife downstream tasks. The analysis of the

temporal inconsistencies, which traditional spatial frequency-based detectors
often overlook. Traditional detectors represent temporal information merely by
stacking spatial frequency spectra across frames, resulting in the failure to
detect temporal artifacts in the pixel plane. Our approach performs a 1D
Fourier transform on the time axis for each pixel, extracting features highly
sensitive to temporal inconsistencies, especially in areas prone to unnatural
movements. To precisely locate regions containing the temporal artifacts, we
introduce an attention proposal module trained in an end-to-end manner.
Additionally, our joint transformer module effectively integrates pixel-wise
temporal frequency features with spatio-temporal context features, expanding

provide a source of information for the detection of threats to networks and
systems. This paper presents a pipeline to use fine-tuned Large Language Models
(LLMs) for anomaly detection and mitigation recommendation using IoT security
logs. Utilizing classical machine learning classifiers as a baseline, three
open-source LLMs are compared for binary and multiclass anomaly detection, with
three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot prompting and fine-tuning using an IoT
dataset. LLMs give better results on multi-class attack classification than the
corresponding baseline models. By mapping detected threats to MITRE CAPEC,
defining a set of IoT-specific mitigation actions, and fine-tuning the models
with those actions, the models are able to provide a combined detection and
recommendation guidance.

                                        <span>  Autonomous scientific research, capable of independently conducting complex
experiments and serving non-specialists, represents a long-held aspiration.
Achieving it requires a fundamental paradigm shift driven by artificial
intelligence (AI). While autonomous experimental systems are emerging, they
remain confined to areas featuring singular objectives and well-defined, simple
experimental workflows, such as chemical synthesis and catalysis. We present an
AI-native autonomous laboratory, targeting highly complex scientific
experiments for applications like autonomous biomolecular engineering. This
system autonomously manages instrumentation, formulates experiment-specific
procedures and optimization heuristics, and concurrently serves multiple user
requests. Founded on a co-design philosophy of models, experiments, and
instruments, the platform supports the co-evolution of AI models and the
automation system. This establishes an end-to-end, multi-user autonomous
laboratory that handles complex, multi-objective experiments across diverse
instrumentation. Our autonomous laboratory supports fundamental nucleic acid
functions-including synthesis, transcription, amplification, and sequencing. It
also enables applications in fields such as disease diagnostics, drug
development, and information storage. Without human intervention, it
autonomously optimizes experimental performance to match state-of-the-art
results achieved by human scientists. In multi-user scenarios, the platform
significantly improves instrument utilization and experimental efficiency. This
platform paves the way for advanced biomaterials research to overcome
dependencies on experts and resource barriers, establishing a blueprint for
science-as-a-service at scale.

mechanism for cross-silo collaboration without accessing participants' data.
However, existing VFL work lacks a mechanism to audit the execution correctness
of the inference software of the data party. To address this problem, we design
a Vertical Federated Inference Auditing (VeFIA) framework. VeFIA helps the task
party to audit whether the data party's inference software is executed as
expected during large-scale inference without leaking the data privacy of the
data party or introducing additional latency to the inference system. The core
of VeFIA is that the task party can use the inference results from a framework
with Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) and the coordinator to validate the
correctness of the data party's computation results. VeFIA guarantees that, as
long as the abnormal inference exceeds 5.4%, the task party can detect
execution anomalies in the inference software with a probability of 99.99%,
without incurring any additional online inference latency. VeFIA's random
sampling validation achieves 100% positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and true positive rate in detecting abnormal inference. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to discuss the correctness
of inference software execution in VFL.

a step-by-step fashion, which limits the ability to capture holistic
relationships among token sequences. Moreover, most visual tokenizers map local
image patches into latent tokens, leading to limited global information. To
address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for
autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local
tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens.
Besides, Hita incorporates two key strategies for improved alignment with the
AR generation process: 1) it arranges a sequential structure with holistic
tokens at the beginning followed by patch-level tokens while using causal
attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) before feeding the
de-quantized tokens into the decoder, Hita adopts a lightweight fusion module
to control information flow to prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive
experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and
outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID}
and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. A detailed analysis of the
holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image
properties such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also
demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

dataset, making it a practical approach in scenarios where interaction with the
environment is costly. Due to this limitation, generalization ability is key to
improving the performance of offline RL algorithms, as demonstrated by recent
successes of offline RL with diffusion models. However, it remains questionable
whether such diffusion models are necessary for highly performing offline RL
algorithms, given their significant computational requirements during
inference. In this paper, we propose Penalized Action Noise Injection (PANI), a
method that simply enhances offline learning by utilizing noise-injected
actions to cover the entire action space, while penalizing according to the
amount of noise injected. This approach is inspired by how diffusion models
have worked in offline RL algorithms. We provide a theoretical foundation for
this method, showing that offline RL algorithms with such noise-injected
actions solve a modified Markov Decision Process (MDP), which we call the noisy
action MDP. PANI is compatible with a wide range of existing off-policy and
offline RL algorithms, and despite its simplicity, it demonstrates significant
performance improvements across various benchmarks.

of ad campaigns. While LLM-based methods offer automated keyword generation,
they face three major limitations: reliance on large-scale query-keyword pair
data, lack of online multi-objective performance monitoring and optimization,
and weak quality control in keyword selection. These issues hinder the agentic
use of LLMs in fully automating keyword decisions by monitoring and reasoning
over key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and
CTA effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose OMS, a keyword
generation framework that is On-the-fly (requires no training data, monitors
online performance, and adapts accordingly), Multi-objective (employs agentic
reasoning to optimize keywords based on multiple performance metrics), and
Self-reflective (agentically evaluates keyword quality). Experiments on
benchmarks and real-world ad campaigns show that OMS outperforms existing
methods; ablation and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of each
component and the quality of generated keywords.

                                        <span>  Intracranial aneurysms (ICA) commonly occur in specific segments of the
Circle of Willis (CoW), primarily, onto thirteen major arterial bifurcations.
An accurate detection of these critical landmarks is necessary for a prompt and
efficient diagnosis. We introduce a fully automated landmark detection approach
for CoW bifurcations using a two-step neural networks process. Initially, an
object detection network identifies regions of interest (ROIs) proximal to the
landmark locations. Subsequently, a modified U-Net with deep supervision is
exploited to accurately locate the bifurcations. This two-step method reduces
various problems, such as the missed detections caused by two landmarks being
close to each other and having similar visual characteristics, especially when
processing the complete MRA Time-of-Flight (TOF). Additionally, it accounts for
the anatomical variability of the CoW, which affects the number of detectable
landmarks per scan. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach using two
cerebral MRA datasets: our In-House dataset which had varying numbers of
landmarks, and a public dataset with standardized landmark configuration. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the highest level of
performance on a bifurcation detection task.

biomedical research. Traditional discovery methods often rely on time-consuming
and resource-intensive experimental screening. To enhance and streamline this
process, we introduce a production-grade, high-throughput platform built on
HelixFold3, HelixDesign-Antibody, which utilizes the high-accuracy structure
prediction model, HelixFold3. The platform facilitates the large-scale
generation of antibody candidate sequences and evaluates their interaction with
antigens. Integrated high-performance computing (HPC) support enables
high-throughput screening, addressing challenges such as fragmented toolchains
and high computational demands. Validation on multiple antigens showcases the
platform's ability to generate diverse and high-quality antibodies, confirming
a scaling law where exploring larger sequence spaces increases the likelihood
of identifying optimal binders. This platform provides a seamless, accessible
solution for large-scale antibody design and is available via the antibody

(XAI) algorithm specifically designed for online patient monitoring systems. In
clinical environments, discovering the causes driving patient risk evolution is
critical for timely intervention, yet existing XAI methods fail to address the
unique requirements of clinical time series explanation tasks. To this end,
DeltaSHAP addresses three key clinical needs: explaining the changes in the
consecutive predictions rather than isolated prediction scores, providing both
magnitude and direction of feature attributions, and delivering these insights
in real time. By adapting Shapley values to temporal settings, our approach
accurately captures feature coalition effects. It further attributes prediction
changes using only the actually observed feature combinations, making it
efficient and practical for time-sensitive clinical applications. We also
introduce new evaluation metrics to evaluate the faithfulness of the
attributions for online time series, and demonstrate through experiments on
online patient monitoring tasks that DeltaSHAP outperforms state-of-the-art XAI
methods in both explanation quality as 62% and computational efficiency as 33%
time reduction on the MIMIC-III decompensation benchmark. We release our code

is critical for advancing their development and application. Traditional
visualization techniques, such as convergence plots, trajectory mapping, and
fitness landscape analysis, often fall short in illustrating the structural
dynamics of the search process, especially in high-dimensional or complex
solution spaces. To address this, we propose a novel representation and
visualization methodology that clusters solution candidates explored by the
algorithm and tracks the evolution of cluster memberships across iterations,
offering a dynamic and interpretable view of the search process. Additionally,
we introduce two metrics - algorithm stability and algorithm similarity- to
quantify the consistency of search trajectories across runs of an individual
algorithm and the similarity between different algorithms, respectively. We
apply this methodology to a set of ten numerical metaheuristic algorithms,
revealing insights into their stability and comparative behaviors, thereby
providing a deeper understanding of their search dynamics.

to investigate the interplay between algorithm configurations and problem
characteristics. Performance footprints are calculated for six modular variants
of the CMA-ES algorithm (modCMA), evaluated on 24 benchmark problems from the
BBOB suite, across two-dimensional settings: 5-dimensional and 30-dimensional.
These footprints provide insights into why different configurations of the same

across configurations due to common interactions with problem properties, as
well as distinct behaviors on the same problem driven by differing problem

losses, highlighting the need for early detection to enable effective
management and improve yields. This study proposes Artificial Neural Network
(ANN)-based image-processing techniques for timely classification and
recognition of rice diseases. Despite the prevailing approach of directly
inputting images of rice leaves into ANNs, there is a noticeable absence of
thorough comparative analysis between the Feature Analysis Detection Model
(FADM) and Direct Image-Centric Detection Model (DICDM), specifically when it
comes to evaluating the effectiveness of Feature Extraction Algorithms (FEAs).
Hence, this research presents initial experiments on the Feature Analysis
Detection Model, utilizing various image Feature Extraction Algorithms,
Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms (DRAs), Feature Selection Algorithms
(FSAs), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The experiments are carried out on
datasets encompassing bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, leaf blast, leaf
scald, Sheath blight rot, and healthy leaf, utilizing 10-fold Cross-Validation
method. A Direct Image-Centric Detection Model is established without the
utilization of any FEA, and the evaluation of classification performance relies
on different metrics. Ultimately, an exhaustive contrast is performed between
the achievements of the Feature Analysis Detection Model and Direct
Image-Centric Detection Model in classifying rice leaf diseases. The results
reveal that the highest performance is attained using the Feature Analysis
Detection Model. The adoption of the proposed Feature Analysis Detection Model
for detecting rice leaf diseases holds excellent potential for improving crop
health, minimizing yield losses, and enhancing overall productivity and
sustainability of rice farming.

analyses of existing approaches. Much work hinge on postulates, employed as
syntactic characterizations: some revision mechanism is equivalent to some
properties. Postulates constraint specific revision instances: certain
revisions update certain beliefs in a certain way. As an example, if the
revision is consistent with the current beliefs, it is incorporated with no
other change. A postulate like this tells what revisions must do and neglect
what they can do. Can they reach a certain state of beliefs? Can they reach all
possible states of beliefs? Can they reach all possible states of beliefs from
no previous belief? Can they reach a dogmatic state of beliefs, where
everything not believed is impossible? Can they make two conditions equally
believed? An application where every possible state of beliefs is sensible
requires each state of beliefs to be reachable. An application where conditions
may be equally believed requires such a belief state to be reachable. An
application where beliefs may become dogmatic requires a way to make them
dogmatic. Such doxastic states need to be reached in a way or another. Not in
specific way, as dictated by a typical belief revision postulate. This is an
ability, not a constraint: the ability of being plastic, equating, dogmatic.
Amnesic, correcting, believer, damascan, learnable are other abilities. Each
revision mechanism owns some of these abilities and lacks the others:
lexicographic, natural, restrained, very radical, full meet, radical, severe,
moderate severe, deep severe, plain severe and deep severe revisions, each of
these revisions is proved to possess certain abilities.

                                        <span>  Few-shot anomaly generation is emerging as a practical solution for
augmenting the scarce anomaly data in industrial quality control settings. An
ideal generator would meet three demands at once, namely (i) keep the normal
background intact, (ii) inpaint anomalous regions to tightly overlap with the
corresponding anomaly masks, and (iii) generate anomalous regions in a
semantically valid location, while still producing realistic, diverse
appearances from only a handful of real examples. Existing diffusion-based
methods usually satisfy at most two of these requirements: global anomaly
generators corrupt the background, whereas mask-guided ones often falter when
the mask is imprecise or misplaced. We propose MAGIC--Mask-guided inpainting
with multi-level perturbations and Context-aware alignment--to resolve all
three issues. At its core, MAGIC fine-tunes a Stable Diffusion inpainting
backbone that preserves normal regions and ensures strict adherence of the
synthesized anomaly to the supplied mask, directly addressing background
corruption and misalignment. To offset the diversity loss that fine-tuning can
cause, MAGIC adds two complementary perturbation strategies: (i) Gaussian
prompt-level perturbation applied during fine-tuning and inference that
broadens the global appearance of anomalies while avoiding low-fidelity textual
appearances, and (ii) mask-guided spatial noise injection that enriches local
texture variations. Additionally, the context-aware mask alignment module forms
semantic correspondences and relocates masks so that every anomaly remains
plausibly contained within the host object, eliminating out-of-boundary
artifacts. Under a consistent identical evaluation protocol on the MVTec-AD
dataset, MAGIC outperforms previous state-of-the-arts in downstream anomaly
tasks.

                                        <span>  Traditional continual learning methods prioritize knowledge retention and
focus primarily on mitigating catastrophic forgetting, implicitly assuming that
the data distribution of previously learned tasks remains static. This
overlooks the dynamic nature of real-world data streams, where concept drift
permanently alters previously seen data and demands both stability and rapid
adaptation.
  We introduce a holistic framework for continual learning under concept drift
that simulates realistic scenarios by evolving task distributions. As a
baseline, we consider Full Relearning (FR), in which the model is retrained
from scratch on newly labeled samples from the drifted distribution. While
effective, this approach incurs substantial annotation and computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Memory Realignment
(AMR), a lightweight alternative that equips rehearsal-based learners with a
drift-aware adaptation mechanism. AMR selectively removes outdated samples of
drifted classes from the replay buffer and repopulates it with a small number
of up-to-date instances, effectively realigning memory with the new
distribution. This targeted resampling matches the performance of FR while
reducing the need for labeled data and computation by orders of magnitude.
  To enable reproducible evaluation, we introduce four concept-drift variants
of standard vision benchmarks: Fashion-MNIST-CD, CIFAR10-CD, CIFAR100-CD, and
Tiny-ImageNet-CD, where previously seen classes reappear with shifted
representations. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets using several
rehearsal-based baselines show that AMR consistently counters concept drift,
maintaining high accuracy with minimal overhead. These results position AMR as
a scalable solution that reconciles stability and plasticity in non-stationary
continual learning environments.

requiring expert time and user compensation. In this work, we developed a
method for synthetic heuristic evaluation using multimodal LLMs' ability to
analyze images and provide design feedback. Comparing our synthetic evaluations
to those by experienced UX practitioners across two apps, we found our
evaluation identified 73% and 77% of usability issues, which exceeded the
performance of 5 experienced human evaluators (57% and 63%). Compared to human
evaluators, the synthetic evaluation's performance maintained consistent
performance across tasks and excelled in detecting layout issues, highlighting
potential attentional and perceptual strengths of synthetic evaluation.
However, synthetic evaluation struggled with recognizing some UI components and
design conventions, as well as identifying across screen violations.
Additionally, testing synthetic evaluations over time and accounts revealed
stable performance. Overall, our work highlights the performance differences
between human and LLM-driven evaluations, informing the design of synthetic
heuristic evaluations.

                                        <span>  Domain-Adaptive Pre-training (DAP) has recently gained attention for its
effectiveness in fine-tuning pre-trained models. Building on this, continual
DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally
incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP
methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory
usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3)
providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the
essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that
addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient
and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and
effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained
models for specific tasks. We also demonstrate that our method can be extended
beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios. Code is available

patterns, thereby lacking interpretability and generalization, especially for
applications with the presence of unseen data. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel knowledge graph-enhanced zero-shot semantic communication
(KGZS-SC) network. Guided by the structured semantic information from a
knowledge graph-based semantic knowledge base (KG-SKB), our scheme provides
generalized semantic representations and enables reasoning for unseen cases.
Specifically, the KG-SKB aligns the semantic features in a shared category
semantics embedding space and enhances the generalization ability of the
transmitter through aligned semantic features, thus reducing communication
overhead by selectively transmitting compact visual semantics. At the receiver,
zero-shot learning (ZSL) is leveraged to enable direct classification for
unseen cases without the demand for retraining or additional computational
overhead, thereby enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of the
classification process in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. The
simulation results conducted on the APY datasets show that the proposed KGZS-SC
network exhibits robust generalization and significantly outperforms existing
SC frameworks in classifying unseen categories across a range of SNR levels.

platforms, shaping how users discover and engage with songs. One common
approach in recommendation systems is collaborative filtering, which suggests
content based on the preferences of users with similar listening patterns to
the target user. However, this method is less effective on media where
interactions are sparse. Music is one such medium, since the average user of a
music streaming service will never listen to the vast majority of tracks. Due
to this sparsity, there are several challenges that have to be addressed with
other methods. This review examines the current state of research in addressing
these challenges, with an emphasis on the role of content filtering in
mitigating biases inherent in collaborative filtering approaches. We explore
various methods of song classification for content filtering, including lyrical
analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs) and audio signal processing
techniques. Additionally, we discuss the potential conflicts between these
different analysis methods and propose avenues for resolving such
discrepancies.

crucial role in film and video post-production. However, current methods
overlook the cinematic language, a critical component of artistic expression in
filmmaking. As a result, their performance deteriorates in scenarios where
Foley targets are only partially visible. To address this challenge, we propose
a simple self-distillation approach to extend V2A models to cinematic language
scenarios. By simulating the cinematic language variations, the student model
learns to align the video features of training pairs with the same audio-visual
correspondences, enabling it to effectively capture the associations between
sounds and partial visual information. Our method not only achieves impressive
improvements under partial visibility across all evaluation metrics, but also
enhances performance on the large-scale V2A dataset, VGGSound.

                                        <span>  Hurricanes cause widespread destruction, resulting in diverse damage types
and severities that require timely and accurate assessment for effective
disaster response. While traditional single-label classification methods fall
short of capturing the complexity of post-hurricane damage, this study
introduces a novel multi-label classification framework for assessing damage
using aerial imagery. The proposed approach integrates a feature extraction
module based on ResNet and a class-specific attention mechanism to identify
multiple damage types within a single image. Using the Rescuenet dataset from
Hurricane Michael, the proposed method achieves a mean average precision of
90.23%, outperforming existing baseline methods. This framework enhances
post-hurricane damage assessment, enabling more targeted and efficient disaster
response and contributing to future strategies for disaster mitigation and
resilience. This paper has been accepted at the ASCE International Conference

                                        <span>  Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning
capabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable
data generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully
automated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in
natural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -
and rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate
NL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the
automated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,
instruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models
achieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal
plans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis
shows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is
contingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the
highest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON
representation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid
plan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task
- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade
performance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from
natural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex
problems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will
inevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and
the tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the
full potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.

decision-making. Despite significant progress, these algorithms are typically
designed for single tasks in specific scenarios, limiting their effectiveness

SurgVisAgent, an end-to-end intelligent surgical vision agent built on
multimodal large language models (MLLMs). SurgVisAgent dynamically identifies
distortion categories and severity levels in endoscopic images, enabling it to
perform a variety of enhancement tasks such as low-light enhancement,
overexposure correction, motion blur elimination, and smoke removal.
Specifically, to achieve superior surgical scenario understanding, we design a
prior model that provides domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, through
in-context few-shot learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, SurgVisAgent
delivers customized image enhancements tailored to a wide range of distortion
types and severity levels, thereby addressing the diverse requirements of
surgeons. Furthermore, we construct a comprehensive benchmark simulating
real-world surgical distortions, on which extensive experiments demonstrate
that SurgVisAgent surpasses traditional single-task models, highlighting its

growth opportunities for ride-service providers by increasing order volume and
gross merchandise value (GMV). On most ride-hailing aggregator platforms,
service providers that offer lower fares are ranked higher in listings and,
consequently, are more likely to be selected by passengers. This competitive
ranking mechanism creates a strong incentive for service providers to adopt
coupon strategies that lower prices to secure a greater number of orders, as
order volume directly influences their long-term viability and sustainability.
Thus, designing an effective coupon strategy that can dynamically adapt to
market fluctuations while optimizing order acquisition under budget constraints
is a critical research challenge. However, existing studies in this area remain
scarce.
  To bridge this gap, we propose FCA-RL, a novel reinforcement learning-based
subsidy strategy framework designed to rapidly adapt to competitors' pricing
adjustments. Our approach integrates two key techniques: Fast Competition
Adaptation (FCA), which enables swift responses to dynamic price changes, and
Reinforced Lagrangian Adjustment (RLA), which ensures adherence to budget
constraints while optimizing coupon decisions on new price landscape.
Furthermore, we introduce RideGym, the first dedicated simulation environment
tailored for ride-hailing aggregators, facilitating comprehensive evaluation
and benchmarking of different pricing strategies without compromising
real-world operational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse
market conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in subsidy optimization for
ride-hailing service providers.

from a large gap between simulation and reality. Diffusion models promise a
step change because they can generate high quality images in minutes, yet
precise control, especially in low data regimes, remains difficult. Although
many adapters now extend diffusion beyond plain text prompts, the effect of
different conditioning schemes on synthetic data quality is poorly understood.
We study eighty diverse visual concepts drawn from four standard object
detection benchmarks and compare two conditioning strategies: prompt based and
layout based. When the set of conditioning cues is narrow, prompt conditioning
yields higher quality synthetic data; as diversity grows, layout conditioning
becomes superior. When layout cues match the full training distribution,
synthetic data raises mean average precision by an average of thirty four
percent and by as much as one hundred seventy seven percent compared with using
real data alone.

learning have shown that static agents can learn to cooperate through a diverse
sort of mechanisms, including noise injection, different types of learning
algorithms and neighbours' payoff knowledge.In this work, using an independent
multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, we study the effects of dilution and mobility
in the spatial version of the prisoner's dilemma. Within this setting,
different possible actions for the algorithm are defined, connecting with
previous results on the classical, non-reinforcement learning spatial
prisoner's dilemma, showcasing the versatility of the algorithm in modeling
different game-theoretical scenarios and the benchmarking potential of this
approach.As a result, a range of effects is observed, including evidence that
games with fixed update rules can be qualitatively equivalent to those with
learned ones, as well as the emergence of a symbiotic mutualistic effect
between populations that forms when multiple actions are defined.

                                        <span>  Urban region representation is crucial for various urban downstream tasks.
However, despite the proliferation of methods and their success, acquiring
general urban region knowledge and adapting to different tasks remains
challenging. Existing work pays limited attention to the fine-grained
functional layout semantics in urban regions, limiting their ability to capture
transferable knowledge across regions. Further, inadequate handling of the
unique features and relationships required for different downstream tasks may
also hinder effective task adaptation. In this paper, we propose a
$\textbf{G}$raph-based $\textbf{U}$rban $\textbf{R}$egion
$\textbf{P}$re-training and $\textbf{P}$rompting framework ($\textbf{GURPP}$)
for region representation learning. Specifically, we first construct an urban
region graph and develop a subgraph-centric urban region pre-training model to
capture the heterogeneous and transferable patterns of entity interactions.
This model pre-trains knowledge-rich region embeddings using contrastive
learning and multi-view learning methods. To further refine these
representations, we design two graph-based prompting methods: a
manually-defined prompt to incorporate explicit task knowledge and a
task-learnable prompt to discover hidden knowledge, which enhances the
adaptability of these embeddings to different tasks. Extensive experiments on
various urban region prediction tasks and different cities demonstrate the
superior performance of our framework.

exploration of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural
innovation with the need for efficient evaluation of architectures to
effectively search such spaces. We investigate surrogate model training for
improving search in highly expressive NAS search spaces based on context-free
grammars. We show that i) surrogate models trained either using zero-cost-proxy
metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM
have high predictive power for the performance of architectures both within and
across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used to filter out bad
architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly speeding
up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates can
be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.

                                        <span>  The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover
classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and
underutilized spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple
shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes,
causing feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose
Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates
phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in
the Fourier domain, thus reinforcing shared structures while preserving
complementary characteristics to improve fusion quality. Unlike prior
approaches that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency
spectra, PAD is the first to introduce explicit amplitude-phase decoupling for
multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase
Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via
convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude
Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency and
low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons,
leveraging SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness.
Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available

normal range after consuming a meal, is a critical indicator of progression
toward type 2 diabetes in people with prediabetes and in healthy individuals. A
key metric for understanding blood glucose dynamics after eating is the
postprandial area under the curve (AUC). Predicting postprandial AUC in advance
based on a person's lifestyle factors, such as diet and physical activity
level, and explaining the factors that affect postprandial blood glucose could
allow an individual to adjust their lifestyle accordingly to maintain normal
glucose levels. In this study, we developed an explainable machine learning
solution, GlucoLens, that takes sensor-driven inputs and uses advanced data
processing, large language models, and trainable machine learning models to
predict postprandial AUC and hyperglycemia from diet, physical activity, and
recent glucose patterns. We used data obtained from wearables in a five-week
clinical trial of 10 adults who worked full-time to develop and evaluate the
proposed computational model that integrates wearable sensing, multimodal data,
and machine learning. Our machine learning model takes multimodal data from
wearable activity and glucose monitoring sensors, along with food and work
logs, and provides an interpretable prediction of the postprandial glucose
pattern. Our GlucoLens system achieves a normalized root mean squared error
(NRMSE) of 0.123 in its best configuration. On average, the proposed technology
provides a 16% better performance level compared to the comparison models.
Additionally, our technique predicts hyperglycemia with an accuracy of 73.3%
and an F1 score of 0.716 and recommends different treatment options to help
avoid hyperglycemia through diverse counterfactual explanations. Code

                                        <span>  Most learning algorithms with formal regret guarantees assume that all
mistakes are recoverable and essentially rely on trying all possible behaviors.
This approach is problematic when some mistakes are "catastrophic", i.e.,
irreparable. We propose an online learning problem where the goal is to
minimize the chance of catastrophe. Specifically, we assume that the payoff in
each round represents the chance of avoiding catastrophe in that round and try
to maximize the product of payoffs (the overall chance of avoiding catastrophe)
while allowing a limited number of queries to a mentor. We also assume that the
agent can transfer knowledge between similar inputs. We first show that in
general, any algorithm either queries the mentor at a linear rate or is nearly
guaranteed to cause catastrophe. However, in settings where the mentor policy
class is learnable in the standard online model, we provide an algorithm whose
regret and rate of querying the mentor both approach 0 as the time horizon
grows. Although our focus is the product of payoffs, we provide matching bounds
for the typical additive regret. Conceptually, if a policy class is learnable
in the absence of catastrophic risk, it is learnable in the presence of
catastrophic risk if the agent can ask for help.

                                        <span>  The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
based tools for 3D phenotyping, especially for maize, has been limited due to
the lack of large and diverse 3D datasets. 2D image datasets fail to capture
essential structural details such as leaf architecture, plant volume, and
spatial arrangements that 3D data provide. To address this limitation, we
present MaizeField3D (https://baskargroup.github.io/MaizeField3D/), a curated
dataset of 3D point clouds of field-grown maize plants from a diverse genetic
panel, designed to be AI-ready for advancing agricultural research. Our dataset
includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a
terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset
were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate
individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples.
This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a
structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the
maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform
Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step
optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We
conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in
segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata
annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and
quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k
points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational
tasks. MaizeField3D will serve as a comprehensive foundational dataset for
AI-driven phenotyping, plant structural analysis, and 3D applications in
agricultural research.

Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of
inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the
significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing
number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource
allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as
health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these
sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall
inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to
quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups
using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate
inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our
approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and
Census 2021 (England & Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting
discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of
the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a
government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both
among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and
non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in
policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach
can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning
systems.

Language Models (MLLM) have shown strong capabilities in general visual
reasoning tasks. However, their performance is still lacking in physical
domains that require understanding diagrams with complex physical structures
and quantitative analysis based on multi-modal information. To address this, we
develop a new framework, named Multi-Modal Scientific Reasoning with Physics
Perception and Simulation (MAPS) based on an MLLM. MAPS decomposes expert-level
multi-modal reasoning task into physical diagram understanding via a Physical
Perception Model (PPM) and reasoning with physical knowledge via a simulator.
The PPM module is obtained by fine-tuning a visual language model using
carefully designed synthetic data with paired physical diagrams and
corresponding simulation language descriptions. At the inference stage, MAPS
integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by
PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to
derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our
collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves
reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models. The results
confirm MAPS offers a promising direction for enhancing multi-modal scientific
reasoning ability of MLLMs. We will release our code, model and dataset used
for our experiments upon publishing of this paper.

                                        <span>  Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm
for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due
to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is
crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based
execution of TGP still remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues:
(1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of
integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between
high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To
address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored
for comprehensive GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel
execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes
variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform
memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second,
EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra-
and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU
utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA
kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with
Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Comprehensive
experiments show that EvoGP achieves up to 140x speedup over state-of-the-art
GPU-based TGP implementations, while maintaining competitive accuracy and
significantly improving scalability under large population sizes. EvoGP is open
source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

                                        <span>  Agentic search such as Deep Research systems-where agents autonomously browse
the web, synthesize information, and return comprehensive citation-backed
answers-represents a major shift in how users interact with web-scale
information. While promising greater efficiency and cognitive offloading, the
growing complexity and open-endedness of agentic search have outpaced existing
evaluation benchmarks and methodologies, which largely assume short search
horizons and static answers. In this paper, we introduce Mind2Web 2, a
benchmark of 130 realistic, high-quality, and long-horizon tasks that require
real-time web browsing and extensive information synthesis, constructed with
over 1000 hours of human labor. To address the challenge of evaluating
time-varying and complex answers, we propose a novel Agent-as-a-Judge
framework. Our method constructs task-specific judge agents based on a
tree-structured rubric design to automatically assess both answer correctness
and source attribution. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of ten frontier
agentic search systems and human performance, along with a detailed error
analysis to draw insights for future development. The best-performing system,
OpenAI Deep Research, can already achieve 50-70% of human performance while
spending half the time, highlighting its great potential. Altogether, Mind2Web
2 provides a rigorous foundation for developing and benchmarking the next
generation of agentic search systems.

                                        <span>  We study language generation in the limit - introduced by Kleinberg and
Mullainathan [KM24] - building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin
[Ang79]. [KM24]'s main result is an algorithm for generating from any countable
language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually generates
unseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth,
i.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces
different notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is
possible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set
of results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of
breadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very
flexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance,
showing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a
higher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other
languages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable
generators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary
but finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such
generators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that
generation with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when
stability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate
breadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich
interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.

                                        <span>  As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral software components in modern
applications, unauthorized model derivations through fine-tuning, merging, and
redistribution have emerged as critical software engineering challenges. Unlike
traditional software where clone detection and license compliance are
well-established, the LLM ecosystem lacks effective mechanisms to detect model
lineage and enforce licensing agreements. This gap is particularly problematic
when open-source model creators, such as Meta's LLaMA, require derivative works
to maintain naming conventions for attribution, yet no technical means exist to
verify compliance.
  To fill this gap, treating LLMs as software artifacts requiring provenance
tracking, we present TensorGuard, a gradient-based fingerprinting framework for
LLM similarity detection and family classification. Our approach extracts
model-intrinsic behavioral signatures by analyzing gradient responses to random
input perturbations across tensor layers, operating independently of training
data, watermarks, or specific model formats. TensorGuard supports the
widely-adopted safetensors format and constructs high-dimensional fingerprints
through statistical analysis of gradient features. These fingerprints enable
two complementary capabilities: direct pairwise similarity assessment between
arbitrary models through distance computation, and systematic family
classification of unknown models via the K-Means clustering algorithm with
domain-informed centroid initialization using known base models. Experimental
evaluation on 58 models comprising 8 base models and 50 derivatives across five
model families (Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, Mistral) demonstrates 94%
classification accuracy under our centroid-initialized K-Means clustering.

                                        <span>  Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.

                                        <span>  In the field of large language model (LLM)-based proof generation, despite
extensive training on large datasets such as ArXiv, LLMs still exhibit only
modest performance on proving tasks of moderate difficulty. We believe that
this is partly due to the widespread presence of suboptimal ordering within the
data for each proof used in training. For example, published proofs often
follow a purely logical order, where each step logically proceeds from the
previous steps based on the deductive rules. This order is designed to
facilitate the verification of the proof's soundness, rather than to help
people and models learn the discovery process of the proof. In proof
generation, we argue that the optimal order for one training data sample occurs
when the relevant intermediate supervision for a particular proof step in the
proof is always positioned to the left of that proof step. We call such order
the intuitively sequential order. We validate our claims using two tasks:
intuitionistic propositional logic theorem-proving and digit multiplication.
Our experiments verify the order effect and provide support for our
explanations. We demonstrate that training is most effective when the proof is
in the intuitively sequential order. Moreover, the order effect and the
performance gap between models trained on different data orders can be
substantial -- with an 11 percent improvement in proof success rate observed in
the propositional logic theorem-proving task, between models trained on the
optimal order compared to the worst order. Lastly, we define a common type of
order issue in advanced math proofs and find that 17.3 percent of theorems with
nontrivial proofs in the first two chapters of a widely used graduate-level
mathematics textbook suffer from this issue. A detailed list of those proofs is
provided in the appendix.

interaction, as handcrafted methods based on fixed joint configurations often
yield rigid and unnatural behaviors. Although recent automated techniques
reduce the need for manual tuning, they tend to fall short by not adequately
bridging the gap between human preferences and model predictions-resulting in a
deficiency of nuanced and realistic expressions due to limited degrees of
freedom and insufficient perceptual integration. In this work, we propose a
novel learning-to-rank framework that leverages human feedback to address this
discrepancy and enhanced the expressiveness of robotic faces. Specifically, we
conduct pairwise comparison annotations to collect human preference data and
develop the Human Affective Pairwise Impressions (HAPI) model, a Siamese
RankNet-based approach that refines expression evaluation. Results obtained via
Bayesian Optimization and online expression survey on a 35-DOF android platform
demonstrate that our approach produces significantly more realistic and
socially resonant expressions of Anger, Happiness, and Surprise than those
generated by baseline and expert-designed methods. This confirms that our
framework effectively bridges the gap between human preferences and model
predictions while robustly aligning robotic expression generation with human
affective responses.

                                        <span>  Accurate detection of traffic anomalies is crucial for effective urban
traffic management and congestion mitigation. We use the Spatiotemporal
Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) framework combining Graph Neural
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory networks to capture complex spatial and
temporal dependencies in traffic data. We apply STGAN to real-time,
minute-by-minute observations from 42 traffic cameras across Gothenburg,
Sweden, collected over several months in 2020. The images are processed to
compute a flow metric representing vehicle density, which serves as input for
the model. Training is conducted on data from April to November 2020, and
validation is performed on a separate dataset from November 14 to 23, 2020. Our
results demonstrate that the model effectively detects traffic anomalies with
high precision and low false positive rates. The detected anomalies include
camera signal interruptions, visual artifacts, and extreme weather conditions
affecting traffic flow.

redefines commercial and social aerial activities. Large artificial
intelligence models (LAIMs) offer transformative potential to further enhance
the intelligence of LAE services. However, deploying LAIMs in LAE poses several
challenges, including the significant gap between their computational/storage
demands and the limited onboard resources of LAE entities, the mismatch between
lab-trained LAIMs and dynamic physical environments, and the inefficiencies of
traditional decoupled designs for sensing, communication, and computation. To
address these issues, we first propose a hierarchical system architecture
tailored for LAIM deployment and present representative LAE application
scenarios. Next, we explore key enabling techniques that facilitate the mutual
co-evolution of LAIMs and low-altitude systems, and introduce a task-oriented
execution pipeline for scalable and adaptive service delivery. Then, the
proposed framework is validated through real-world case studies. Finally, we
outline open challenges to inspire future research.

                                        <span>  The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains
a key challenge. While post-training techniques like Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have
achieved notable success, they often introduce computational inefficiencies and
training instability. In this paper, we propose Feature-level constrained
Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to simplify the
alignment process while ensuring stability. FPO leverages pre-trained Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) and introduces feature-level constraints, allowing for
efficient, sparsity-enforced alignment. Our approach enjoys efficiency by using
sparse features activated in a well-trained sparse autoencoder and the quality
of sequential KL divergence by using the feature-level offline reference.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FPO achieves a
5.08% absolute improvement in win rate with much lower computational cost
compared to state-of-the-art baselines, making it a promising solution for
efficient and controllable LLM alignments.

Programming (ASP). The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality,
and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and

designed to learn end-to-end control policies for humanoid robot soccer
directly from real-world gameplay recordings. Using data collected from RoboCup
competitions, the model predicts joint command trajectories from multi-modal
sensor inputs, including vision, proprioception, and game state. We employ a
distillation technique to enable real-time inference on embedded platforms that
reduces the multi-step diffusion process to a single step. Our results
demonstrate the model's ability to replicate complex motion behaviors such as
walking, kicking, and fall recovery both in simulation and on physical robots.
Although high-level tactical behavior remains limited, this work provides a
robust foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning or preference
optimization methods. We release the dataset, pretrained models, and code

comparisons of these embeddings have largely focused on their numerical
performance in classification-related downstream applications. However, an
interpretable comparison of different embeddings requires identifying and
analyzing mismatches between sample groups clustered within the embedding
spaces. In this work, we propose the \emph{Spectral Pairwise Embedding
Comparison (SPEC)} framework to compare embeddings and identify their
differences in clustering a reference dataset. Our approach examines the kernel
matrices derived from two embeddings and leverages the eigendecomposition of
the difference kernel matrix to detect sample clusters that are captured
differently by the two embeddings. We present a scalable implementation of this
kernel-based approach, with computational complexity that grows linearly with
the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization problem using this
framework to align two embeddings, ensuring that clusters identified in one
embedding are also captured in the other model. We provide numerical results
demonstrating the SPEC's application to compare and align embeddings on
large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and MS-COCO. The project page is

                                        <span>  Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used for medical imaging
tasks. However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are
trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the
strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image
segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of
publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation
algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias
mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based
CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance
reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to
mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root
causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using
models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be
mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the
underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority
White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for
both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias
mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing
the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation
performance and no statistically significant bias.

                                        <span>  Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the
visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent
evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an
unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a
technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial
intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining
human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous
intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource
consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To
address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary
framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a
particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud
framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers,
and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model
inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to
a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling
effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource
constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based
intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging
communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI
models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses
the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced
intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI
services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and
communication systems.

                                        <span>  We introduce Interleaved Gibbs Diffusion (IGD), a novel generative modeling
framework for discrete-continuous data, focusing on problems with important,
implicit and unspecified constraints in the data. Most prior works on discrete
and discrete-continuous diffusion assume a factorized denoising distribution,
which can hinder the modeling of strong dependencies between random variables
in such problems. We empirically demonstrate a significant improvement in 3-SAT
performance out of the box by switching to a Gibbs-sampling style discrete
diffusion model which does not assume factorizability. Motivated by this, we
introduce IGD which generalizes discrete time Gibbs sampling type Markov chain
for the case of discrete-continuous generation. IGD allows for seamless
integration between discrete and continuous denoisers while theoretically
guaranteeing exact reversal of a suitable forward process. Further, it provides
flexibility in the choice of denoisers, allows conditional generation via
state-space doubling and inference time refinement. Empirical evaluations on
three challenging generation tasks - molecule structures, layouts and tabular
data - demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, IGD achieves
state-of-the-art results without relying on domain-specific inductive biases
like equivariant diffusion or auxiliary losses. We explore a wide range of
modeling, and interleaving strategies along with hyperparameters in each of
these problems.

                                        <span>  Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a novel task enabling Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate in outdoor environments through natural
language instructions and visual cues. It remains challenging due to the
complex spatial relationships in outdoor aerial scenes. In this paper, we
propose an end-to-end zero-shot framework for aerial VLN tasks, where the large
language model (LLM) is introduced as our agent for action prediction.
Specifically, we develop a novel Semantic-Topo-Metric Representation (STMR) to
enhance the spatial reasoning ability of LLMs. This is achieved by extracting
and projecting instruction-related semantic masks of landmarks into a top-down
map that contains the location information of surrounding landmarks. Further,
this map is transformed into a matrix representation with distance metrics as
the text prompt to the LLM, for action prediction according to the instruction.
Experiments conducted in real and simulation environments have successfully
proved the effectiveness and robustness of our method, achieving 15.9% and
12.5% improvements (absolute) in Oracle Success Rate (OSR) on AerialVLN-S
dataset.

physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

                                        <span>  The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a complex combinatorial
optimization problem. While online Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown
promise by quickly finding acceptable solutions for JSSP, it faces key
limitations: it requires extensive training interactions from scratch leading
to sample inefficiency, cannot leverage existing high-quality solutions from
traditional methods like Constraint Programming (CP), and require simulated
environments to train in, which are impracticable to build for complex
scheduling environments. We introduce Offline Learned Dispatching (Offline-LD),
an offline reinforcement learning approach for JSSP, which addresses these
limitations by learning from historical scheduling data. Our approach is
motivated by scenarios where historical scheduling data and expert solutions
are available or scenarios where online training of RL approaches with
simulated environments is impracticable. Offline-LD introduces maskable
variants of two Q-learning methods, namely, Maskable Quantile Regression DQN
(mQRDQN) and discrete maskable Soft Actor-Critic (d-mSAC), that are able to
learn from historical data, through Conservative Q-Learning (CQL). Moreover, we
present a novel entropy bonus modification for d-mSAC, for maskable action
spaces. Moreover, we introduce a novel reward normalization method for JSSP in
an offline RL setting. Our experiments demonstrate that Offline-LD outperforms
online RL on both generated and benchmark instances when trained on only 100
solutions generated by CP. Notably, introducing noise to the expert dataset
yields comparable or superior results to using the expert dataset, with the
same amount of instances, a promising finding for real-world applications,
where data is inherently noisy and imperfect.

conventional Quantized Artificial Neural Networks (QNNs) due to their
event-driven, spike-based computation. However, prevailing energy evaluations
often oversimplify, focusing on computational aspects while neglecting critical
overheads like comprehensive data movement and memory access. Such
simplifications can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the true energy
benefits of SNNs. This paper presents a rigorous re-evaluation. We establish a
fair baseline by mapping rate-encoded SNNs with $T$ timesteps to functionally
equivalent QNNs with $\lceil \log_2(T+1) \rceil$ bits. This ensures both models
have comparable representational capacities, as well has similar hardware
requirement, enabling meaningful energy comparisons. We introduce a detailed
analytical energy model encompassing core computation and data movement (sparse
and dense activations, weights). Using this model, we systematically explore a
wide parameter space, including intrinsic network characteristics ($T$, spike
rate $s_r$, QNN sparsity $\gamma$, model size $N$, weight bit-level) and
hardware characteristics (memory system and network-on-chip). Our analysis
identifies specific operational regimes where SNNs genuinely offer superior
energy efficiency. For example, under typical neuromorphic hardware conditions,
SNNs with moderate time windows ($T \in [5,10]$) require an average spike rate
($s_r$) below 6.4% to outperform equivalent QNNs. These insights guide the
design of genuinely energy-efficient neural network solutions.

significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving
consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural
knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we
introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate
cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering
benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages,
focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall
assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark
appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results
reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle
to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust
approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

                                        <span>  The paradigm of large language models in natural language processing (NLP)
has also shown promise in modeling biological languages, including proteins,
RNA, and DNA. Both the auto-regressive generation paradigm and evaluation
metrics have been transferred from NLP to biological sequence modeling.
However, the intrinsic structural correlations in natural and biological
languages differ fundamentally. Therefore, we revisit the notion of language in
biological systems to better understand how NLP successes can be effectively
translated to biological domains. By treating the 3D structure of biomolecules
as the semantic content of a sentence and accounting for the strong
correlations between residues or bases, we highlight the importance of
structural evaluation and demonstrate the applicability of the auto-regressive
paradigm in biological language modeling. Code can be found at

in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

                                        <span>  AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.

                                        <span>  The discovery of causal relations from observed data has attracted
significant interest from disciplines such as economics, social sciences, and
biology. In practical applications, considerable knowledge of the underlying
systems is often unavailable, and real data are usually associated with
nonlinear causal structures, which makes the direct use of most conventional
causality analysis methods difficult. This study proposes a novel quantum
Peter-Clark (qPC) algorithm for causal discovery that does not require any
assumptions about the underlying model structures. Based on conditional
independence tests in a class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
characterized by quantum circuits, the proposed algorithm can explore causal
relations from the observed data drawn from arbitrary distributions. We
conducted systematic experiments on fundamental graphs of causal structures,
demonstrating that the qPC algorithm exhibits better performance, particularly
with smaller sample sizes compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore,
we proposed a novel optimization approach based on Kernel Target Alignment
(KTA) for determining hyperparameters of quantum kernels. This method
effectively reduced the risk of false positives in causal discovery, enabling
more reliable inference. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate
that the quantum algorithm can empower classical algorithms for accurate
inference in causal discovery, supporting them in regimes where classical
algorithms typically fail. In addition, the effectiveness of this method was
validated using the datasets on Boston housing prices, heart disease, and
biological signaling systems as real-world applications. These findings
highlight the potential of quantum-based causal discovery methods in addressing
practical challenges, particularly in small-sample scenarios, where traditional
approaches have shown significant limitations.

a novel cognition framework. This representation-centric approach models the
input space constructively as a distributed hierarchical structure in an
input-agnostic way. We compared our approach with both current state-of-the-art
unsupervised learning classification, with current state-of-the-art small and
incomplete datasets classification, and with current state-of-the-art cancer
type classification. We show how our proposal outperforms previous
state-of-the-art. We also evaluate some cognition-like properties of our
proposal where it not only outperforms the compared algorithms (even supervised
learning ones), but it also shows a different, more cognition-like, behaviour.

detecting neurological conditions and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the
most predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which
has been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as
Alzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for weakly supervised pre-training of DL
models in transfer learning settings has also recently shown promising results,
especially when dealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the
other hand, anatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can
provide important information for learning good representations that can be
transferred to many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an
anatomical foundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical
information in a weakly contrastive learning approach, and ii.) achieves
state-of-the-art performances across many different downstream tasks. To
validate our approach we consider 12 different downstream tasks for the
diagnosis of different conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease, autism spectrum
disorder, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, we also target the prediction of 10
different clinical assessment scores using structural MRI data. Our findings
show that incorporating anatomical information during pre-training leads to
more robust and generalizable representations. Pre-trained models can be found

China, can engage AI-assisted co-creation to express personal narratives that
are often fragmented, underrepresented, or difficult to verbalize. Through a
pilot workshop combining oral storytelling and the symbolic reconstruction of
Hanzi, participants shared memories of migration and recreated new character
forms using Xiaozhuan glyphs, suggested by the Large Language Model (LLM),
together with physical materials. Supported by human facilitation and a soft AI
presence, participants transformed lived experience into visual and tactile
expressions without requiring digital literacy. This approach offers new
perspectives on human-AI collaboration and aging by repositioning AI not as a
content producer but as a supportive mechanism, and by supporting narrative
agency within sociotechnical systems.

                                        <span>  Echocardiography is an essential medical technique for diagnosing
cardiovascular diseases, but its high operational complexity has led to a
shortage of trained professionals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel
probe movement guidance algorithm that has the potential to be applied in
guiding robotic systems or novices with probe pose adjustment for high-quality
standard plane image acquisition.Cardiac ultrasound faces two major challenges:
(1) the inherently complex structure of the heart, and (2) significant
individual variations. Previous works have only learned the population-averaged
structure of the heart rather than personalized cardiac structures, leading to
a performance bottleneck. Clinically, we observe that sonographers dynamically
adjust their interpretation of a patient's cardiac anatomy based on prior
scanning sequences, consequently refining their scanning strategies. Inspired
by this, we propose a novel sequence-aware self-supervised pre-training method.
Specifically, our approach learns personalized three-dimensional cardiac
structural features by predicting the masked-out image features and probe
movement actions in a scanning sequence. We hypothesize that if the model can
predict the missing content it has acquired a good understanding of
personalized cardiac structure. Extensive experiments on a large-scale expert
scanning dataset with 1.31 million samples demonstrate that our proposed
sequence-aware paradigm can effectively reduce probe guidance errors compared
to other advanced baseline methods. Our code will be released after acceptance.

as a challenging reasoning task. In this paper, we show that the current
benchmarks for CQA might not be as complex as we think, as the way they are
built distorts our perception of progress in this field. For example, we find
that in these benchmarks, most queries (up to 98% for some query types) can be
reduced to simpler problems, e.g., link prediction, where only one link needs
to be predicted. The performance of state-of-the-art CQA models decreases
significantly when such models are evaluated on queries that cannot be reduced
to easier types. Thus, we propose a set of more challenging benchmarks composed
of queries that require models to reason over multiple hops and better reflect
the construction of real-world KGs. In a systematic empirical investigation,
the new benchmarks show that current methods leave much to be desired from
current CQA methods.

human-level performance. These models come with clear limitations: they can
produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily
misused. Yet, many scientists use them for their scholarly writing. But how
wide-spread is such LLM usage in the academic literature? To answer this
question for the field of biomedical research, we present an unbiased,
large-scale approach: we study vocabulary changes in over 15 million biomedical
abstracts from 2010--2024 indexed by PubMed, and show how the appearance of
LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. This
excess word analysis suggests that at least 13.5% of 2024 abstracts were
processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries,
and journals, reaching 40% for some subcorpora. We show that LLMs have had an
unprecedented impact on scientific writing in biomedical research, surpassing
the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.

                                        <span>  Recent foundational models for tabular data, such as TabPFN, excel at
adapting to new tasks via in-context learning, but remain constrained to a
fixed, pre-defined number of target dimensions-often necessitating costly
ensembling strategies. We trace this constraint to a deeper architectural
shortcoming: these models lack target equivariance, so that permuting target
dimension orderings alters their predictions. This deficiency gives rise to an
irreducible "equivariance gap", an error term that introduces instability in
predictions. We eliminate this gap by designing a fully target-equivariant
architecture-ensuring permutation invariance via equivariant encoders,
decoders, and a bi-attention mechanism. Empirical evaluation on standard
classification benchmarks shows that, on datasets with more classes than those
seen during pre-training, our model matches or surpasses existing methods while
incurring lower computational overhead.

the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of
contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical
treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can
quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The
consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared
simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to
the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad
exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a
significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature
for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are
arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the
significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces
two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one
handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript
addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes
some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.

                                        <span>  The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred
discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including
classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it
is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual
coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most
existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses
relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its
findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to
established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different
LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using
German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare
several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate
the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance
differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory
levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting
approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal
classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey
participation results in different categorical distributions when not using
fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for
methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their
substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively
analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need
to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response
classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the
growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be
efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.

                                        <span>  The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great
promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy
concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances
in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation,
existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and
therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while
preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM,
a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support
flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs
a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel
Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of
input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous
clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic
and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it
against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset
for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we
perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and
clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world
scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges
such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its
utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis. Project page is at

                                        <span>  Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders.
Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality
for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV)
analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion
artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency
in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV
ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only
sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a
cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a
bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features.
This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase.
Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that
explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible.
Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between
labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV
dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior
cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD:
1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at
https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.

                                        <span>  Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing,
particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential
under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB
histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their
sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method
utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to
estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse
images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate
the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their
directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting
environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source
localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement.
Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient
analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world
illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.

  In this study, we explore the capabilities and applications of large language

to support test maintenance. We conducted a case study at Ericsson AB where we
explore the triggers that indicate the need for test maintenance, the actions

LLMs in an industrial setting. We also propose and demonstrate a multi-agent

real-world scenarios. It can effectively alleviate the burden of annotation by
matching entities in existing knowledge bases with snippets in the text but
suffer from the label noise. Recent works attempt to adopt the teacher-student
framework to gradually refine the training labels and improve the overall
robustness. However, these teacher-student methods achieve limited performance
because the poor calibration of the teacher network produces incorrectly
pseudo-labeled samples, leading to error propagation. Therefore, we propose:
(1) Uncertainty-Aware Teacher Learning that leverages the prediction
uncertainty to reduce the number of incorrect pseudo labels in the
self-training stage; (2) Student-Student Collaborative Learning that allows the
transfer of reliable labels between two student networks instead of
indiscriminately relying on all pseudo labels from its teacher, and further
enables a full exploration of mislabeled samples rather than simply filtering
unreliable pseudo-labeled samples. We evaluate our proposed method on five
DS-NER datasets, demonstrating that our method is superior to the
state-of-the-art DS-NER methods.

                                        <span>  Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing
diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image
restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in
degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect
text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel
restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and
textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale
benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and
complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion
framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion
models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from
joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,
which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text
recognition accuracy. See our project page: https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/TAIR/

integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).
Unlike traditional rule-based ABM, the proposed framework leverages LLM to
enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population

personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual

                                        <span>  Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a
promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding
capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit
sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence
information into the embedding of the last token. However, LLMs are mostly
decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the
sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of
sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token. To this
end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each
layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next
layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence
information under the causal attention mechanism. The proposed TP technique is
a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly
integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and
autoregressive LLMs. Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our
proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing
prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring
negligible additional inference cost.

is critical to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. While computer vision
approaches for automatic recognition of perioperative events can identify
bottlenecks for OR optimization, privacy concerns limit the use of OR videos
for automated event detection. We propose a two-stage pipeline for
privacy-preserving OR video analysis and event detection. First, we leverage
vision foundation models for depth estimation and semantic segmentation to
generate de-identified Digital Twins (DT) of the OR from conventional RGB
videos. Second, we employ the SafeOR model, a fused two-stream approach that
processes segmentation masks and depth maps for OR event detection. Evaluation
on an internal dataset of 38 simulated surgical trials with five event classes
shows that our DT-based approach achieves performance on par with -- and
sometimes better than -- raw RGB video-based models for OR event detection.
Digital Twins enable privacy-preserving OR workflow analysis, facilitating the
sharing of de-identified data across institutions and potentially enhancing
model generalizability by mitigating domain-specific appearance differences.

from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

                                        <span>  Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences usually requires
fine-tuning methods such as RLHF and DPO. These methods directly optimize the
model parameters, so they cannot be used in test-time to improve model
performance, nor are they applicable when the model weights are not accessible.
In contrast, test-time methods sidestep weight updates by leveraging reward
functions to guide and improve output quality. However, they incur high
inference costs, and their one-shot guidance is often based on imperfect reward
or value functions, leading to suboptimal outputs. In this work, we present a
method named Iterative Reweight-then-Optimize (IRO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that performs RL-style alignment of the (frozen) base model
without touching its parameters. During training, each iteration (i) samples
candidates from the base model, (ii) resamples using current value functions,
and (iii) trains a new lightweight value function that guides the next decoding
pass. At test time, the value functions are used to guide the base model
generation via a search-based optimization process. Notably, users can apply
IRO to align a model on their own dataset, similar to OpenAI's reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT), but without requiring access to the model weights.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

                                        <span>  Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods infer an agent's reward function
using demonstrations of expert behavior. A Bayesian IRL approach models a
distribution over candidate reward functions, capturing a degree of uncertainty
in the inferred reward function. This is critical in some applications, such as
those involving clinical data. Typically, Bayesian IRL algorithms require large
demonstration datasets, which may not be available in practice. In this work,
we incorporate existing domain-specific data to achieve better posterior
concentration rates. We study a common setting in clinical and biological
applications where we have access to expert demonstrations and known reward
functions for a set of training tasks. Our aim is to learn the reward function
of a new test task given limited expert demonstrations. Existing Bayesian IRL
methods impose restrictions on the form of input data, thus limiting the
incorporation of training task data. To better leverage information from
training tasks, we introduce kernel density Bayesian inverse reinforcement
learning (KD-BIRL). Our approach employs a conditional kernel density
estimator, which uses the known reward functions of the training tasks to
improve the likelihood estimation across a range of reward functions and
demonstration samples. Our empirical results highlight KD-BIRL's faster
concentration rate in comparison to baselines, particularly in low test task
expert demonstration data regimes. Additionally, we are the first to provide
theoretical guarantees of posterior concentration for a Bayesian IRL algorithm.
Taken together, this work introduces a principled and theoretically grounded
framework that enables Bayesian IRL to be applied across a variety of domains.

                                        <span>  Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional
sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches
(e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such
methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers
have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However,
effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic
content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the
powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative
multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first
decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central
commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to
address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each
model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on
MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six
prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without
necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.

framework that combines full-volume tumor localization with refined
region-of-interest (ROI) segmentation, enhanced by anatomically aware
post-processing. The first-stage model generates a coarse prediction, followed
by anatomically informed filtering based on lung overlap, proximity to lung

second-stage model trained with uncertainty-aware loss functions to improve
accuracy and boundary calibration in ambiguous regions. Experiments on private

fewer false positives and enhanced spatial interpretability. These results
highlight the value of combining uncertainty modeling and anatomical priors in
cascaded segmentation pipelines for robust and clinically meaningful tumor
delineation. On the Orlando dataset, our framework improved Swin UNETR Dice
from 0.4690 to 0.6447. Reduction in spurious components was strongly correlated

robotics, driven by the need for autonomous systems that can perceive, reason,
and act in complex physical environments. While single-arm systems have shown
strong task performance, collaborative dual-arm systems are essential for
handling more intricate tasks involving rigid, deformable, and
tactile-sensitive objects. To advance this goal, we launched the RoboTwin
Dual-Arm Collaboration Challenge at the 2nd MEIS Workshop, CVPR 2025. Built on
the RoboTwin Simulation platform (1.0 and 2.0) and the AgileX COBOT-Magic Robot
platform, the competition consisted of three stages: Simulation Round 1,
Simulation Round 2, and a final Real-World Round. Participants totally tackled
17 dual-arm manipulation tasks, covering rigid, deformable, and tactile-based
scenarios. The challenge attracted 64 global teams and over 400 participants,
producing top-performing solutions like SEM and AnchorDP3 and generating
valuable insights into generalizable bimanual policy learning. This report
outlines the competition setup, task design, evaluation methodology, key
findings and future direction, aiming to support future research on robust and

                                        <span>  Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box
surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen
black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods
deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability;
however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the
representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic
information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode
rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain
under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with
object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To
remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on
the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With
this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the
early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich
teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the
semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on
empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on
regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct
extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate
consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks,
comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed
Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

                                        <span>  The study of mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer a model to
explain its behaviors. While recent studies have focused on the static
mechanism of a certain behavior, the learning dynamics inside a model remain to
be explored. In this work, we develop an interpretable fine-tuning method for
analyzing the mechanism behind learning. We first introduce the concept of
node-level intrinsic dimensionality to describe the learning process of a model
in a computational graph. Based on our theory, we propose circuit-tuning, a
two-stage algorithm that iteratively builds the minimal subgraph for a specific
task and updates the key parameters in a heuristic way. Experimental results
confirm the existence of the intrinsic dimensionality at the node level and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for transparent and interpretable
fine-tuning. We visualize and analyze the circuits before, during, and after
fine-tuning, providing new insights into the self-organization mechanism of a
neural network in the learning process.

                                        <span>  The rapid growth of large models has raised concerns about their
environmental impact and equity in accessibility due to significant
computational costs. Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) offer a lightweight solution for
finetuning large models, resulting in an abundance of publicly available
adapters tailored to diverse domains. We ask: Can these pretrained adapters be
leveraged to further streamline adaptation to new tasks while addressing these
challenges? We introduce EigenLoRAx, a parameter-efficient finetuning method
that recycles existing adapters to create a principal subspace aligned with
their shared domain knowledge which can be further augmented with orthogonal
basis vectors in low-resource scenarios. This enables rapid adaptation to new
tasks by learning only lightweight coefficients on the principal components of
the subspace-eliminating the need to finetune entire adapters. EigenLoRAx
requires significantly fewer parameters and memory, improving efficiency for
both training and inference. Our method demonstrates strong performance across
diverse domains and tasks, offering a scalable for edge-based applications,
personalization, and equitable deployment of large models in
resource-constrained environments.

prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), but
their reliance on manually crafted, task-specific prompts limits adaptability
and efficiency. We introduce Mixture of Reasoning (MoR), a training framework
that embeds diverse reasoning strategies into LLMs for autonomous,
task-adaptive reasoning without external prompt engineering. MoR has two
phases: Thought Generation, creating reasoning chain templates with models like
GPT-4o, and SFT Dataset Construction, pairing templates with benchmark datasets
for supervised fine-tuning. Our experiments show that MoR significantly
enhances performance, with MoR150 achieving 0.730 (2.2% improvement) using CoT
prompting and 0.734 (13.5% improvement) compared to baselines. MoR eliminates
the need for task-specific prompts, offering a generalizable solution for
robust reasoning across diverse tasks.

artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

cheaper than committing it. In dynamic, low-trust environments, autonomous AI
agents benefit from delegating work to sub-agents, yet correctness cannot be
assured through upfront specification or centralized oversight. We propose a
protocol that enforces correctness through collateralized claims in a recursive
verification game. Tasks are published as intents, and solvers compete to
fulfill them. Selected solvers carry out tasks under risk, with correctness
checked post hoc by verifiers. Any challenger can challenge a result by staking
against it to trigger the verification process. Incorrect agents are slashed
and correct opposition is rewarded, with an escalation path that penalizes
erroneous verifiers themselves. When incentives are aligned across solvers,
challengers, and verifiers, falsification conditions make correctness the Nash
equilibrium.

                                        <span>  This paper presents an extension of the DRIFT invariant state estimation
framework, enabling robust fusion of GPS and IMU data for accurate pose and
heading estimation. Originally developed for testing and usage on a marine
autonomous surface vehicle (ASV), this approach can also be utilized on other
mobile systems. Building upon the original proprioceptive only DRIFT algorithm,
we develop a symmetry-preserving sensor fusion pipeline utilizing the invariant
extended Kalman filter (InEKF) to integrate global position updates from GPS
directly into the correction step. Crucially, we introduce a novel heading
correction mechanism that leverages GPS course-over-ground information in
conjunction with IMU orientation, overcoming the inherent unobservability of
yaw in dead-reckoning. The system was deployed and validated on a customized
Blue Robotics BlueBoat, but the methodological focus is on the algorithmic
approach to fusing exteroceptive and proprioceptive sensors for drift-free
localization and reliable orientation estimation. This work provides an open
source solution for accurate yaw observation and localization in challenging or
GPS-degraded conditions, and lays the groundwork for future experimental and
comparative studies.

                                        <span>  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a compelling framework for tackling
complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they are often expensive to train. In
this paper, we propose a novel VLA approach that leverages the competitive
performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on 2D images to directly infer
robot end-effector poses in image frame coordinates. Unlike prior VLA models
that output low-level controls, our model predicts trajectory waypoints, making
it both more efficient to train and robot embodiment agnostic. Despite its
lightweight design, our next-token prediction architecture effectively learns
meaningful and executable robot trajectories. We further explore the
underutilized potential of incorporating depth images, inference-time
techniques such as decoding strategies, and demonstration-conditioned action
generation. Our model is trained on a simulated dataset and exhibits strong
sim-to-real transfer capabilities. We evaluate our approach using a combination
of simulated and real data, demonstrating its effectiveness on a real robotic
system.

                                        <span>  Trajectory planning in robotics is understood as generating a sequence of
joint configurations that will lead a robotic agent, or its manipulator, from
an initial state to the desired final state, thus completing a manipulation
task while considering constraints like robot kinematics and the environment.
Typically, this is achieved via sampling-based planners, which are
computationally intensive. Recent advances demonstrate that trajectory planning
can also be performed by supervised sequence learning of trajectories, often
requiring only a single or fixed number of passes through a neural
architecture, thus ensuring a bounded computation time. Such fully supervised
approaches, however, perform imitation learning; they do not learn based on
whether the trajectories can successfully reach a goal, but try to reproduce
observed trajectories. In our work, we build on this approach and propose a
cognitively inspired self-supervised learning scheme based on a recurrent
architecture for building a trajectory model. We evaluate the feasibility of
the proposed method on a task of kinematic planning for a robotic arm. The
results suggest that the model is able to learn to generate trajectories only
using given paired forward and inverse kinematics models, and indicate that
this novel method could facilitate planning for more complex manipulation tasks
requiring adaptive solutions.

                                        <span>  The remarkable advancements of vision and language foundation models in
multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation has sparked growing efforts
to extend such intelligence to the physical world, fueling the flourishing of
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we
observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision
and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain
of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and
actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further
determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how
action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language
description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation,
raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive
understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA
development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to
categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action
tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and
identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we
offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight
underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future
research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.

closed-loop interaction, multi-agent long-horizon planning, and scene graph
updating). This report details the model architecture, data construction,
multi-stage training strategies, infrastructure and practical applications. We

                                        <span>  Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for
real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous
teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand
postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent
dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their
structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we
propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables
dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion
patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the
teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to
complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible
dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures
used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM
(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to
identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and
operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and
imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types
significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform
diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.

                                        <span>  Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics
applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational
resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental
contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise
sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and
require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for
selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional
training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework
designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router.
MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity
and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large
Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts,
and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on
various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it
consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE
pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to
the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual
descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability
of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an
alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.

reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large
world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently
distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact
model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving
performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a
state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M
parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of
our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task
knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training
quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical
deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in
large world models, paving the way for more efficient and accessible multi-task

                                        <span>  Current pelvic fixation techniques rely on rigid drilling tools, which
inherently constrain the placement of rigid medical screws in the complex
anatomy of pelvis. These constraints prevent medical screws from following
anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear
trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement
of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw
misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to
repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4
degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic
CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling
trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy. The
performance of the pelvic CT-SDR was thoroughly evaluated through several
S-shape drilling experiments in simulated bone phantoms.

levels of the spinal column. Additionally, we propose a four-Phase calibration,

spine holder phantom by integrating the CT-SDR with a seven-degree-of-freedom
robotic manipulator. The functionality of this framework is validated through
planar and out-of-plane steerable drilling experiments in vertebral phantoms.

screws in spinal fixation procedures, and to leverage our recently developed
Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) and Flexible Pedicle Screw
(FPS), in this paper, we introduce the concept of Augmented Bridge Spinal
Fixation (AB-SF). In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first
drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are
passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the
cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles
and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and
study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system
(i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation
scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at
different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the
drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation
process.

policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements
of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue,
we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion
policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene.
Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the
denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel
spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly
on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal
U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency.
In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization
across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement
over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks
including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments. Code is available at

where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale
manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links,
this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate.
This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed
to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly
enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike
traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves
computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune
the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the
algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane
application, as well as simulated environment data.

                                        <span>  This paper presents a Riemannian metric-based model to solve the optimal path
planning problem on two-dimensional smooth submanifolds in high-dimensional
space. Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a
two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional
Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the
environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in
high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the
two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian
metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane.
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for
scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can
help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height,
ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R
algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the
original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace.
The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the
theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.

                                        <span>  Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

deviations from expectations can confuse users. Explanations of the robot's
reasoning process can help users to understand the robot intentions. However,
when to provide explanations and what they contain are important to avoid user
annoyance. We have investigated user preferences for explanation demand and
content for a robot that helps with daily cleaning tasks in a kitchen. Our
results show that users want explanations in surprising situations and prefer
concise explanations that clearly state the intention behind the confusing
action and the contextual factors that were relevant to this decision. Based on
these findings, we propose two algorithms to identify surprising actions and to
construct effective explanations for Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) robots. Our
algorithms can be easily integrated in the BDI reasoning process and pave the
way for better human-robot interaction with context- and user-specific
explanations.

multiple agents covering an environment where regions of interest change over
time. This problem has broad applications, including the deployment of
autonomous taxis and coordination in search and rescue operations. The
achievement of effective coverage is complicated by the presence of
time-varying density functions, nonlinear agent dynamics, and stringent system
and safety constraints. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-agent
control framework for time-varying coverage under nonlinear constrained
dynamics. Our approach integrates a reference trajectory planner and a tracking
model predictive control (MPC) scheme, which operate at different frequencies
within a multi-rate framework. For periodic density functions, we demonstrate
closed-loop convergence to an optimal configuration of trajectories and provide
formal guarantees regarding constraint satisfaction, collision avoidance, and
recursive feasibility. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm capable
of handling nonperiodic density functions, making the approach suitable for
practical applications. Finally, we validate our method through hardware
experiments using a fleet of four miniature race cars.

form-flexible grippers for adaptive grasping. The design is based on the hybrid
jamming and suction mechanism, which deforms to handle objects that vary
significantly in size from the aperture, including both larger and smaller
parts. Compared with traditional grippers, the gripper achieves self-closing to
form an airtight seal. Under a vacuum, a wide range of grasping is realized
through the passive morphing mechanism at the interface that harmonizes
pressure and flow rate. This hybrid gripper showcases the capability to
securely grasp an egg, as small as 54.5% of its aperture, while achieving a
maximum load-to-mass ratio of 94.3.

predetermined models and historic data is problematic because they do not
encompass the dynamic and fast-changing nature of such systems. To this end, we
propose a concept that actively generates a dynamic system model at runtime and
utilizes it to locate root causes. The goal is to be applicable to all kinds of
robotic systems that share a similar software design. Additionally, it should
exhibit minimal overhead and enhance independence from expert attention.

                                        <span>  Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the
potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous
experimentation. Yet, their application remains constrained by rigid protocol
design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error
handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS
(Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that
integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and
execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the
Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the
Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the
Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and
anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture
tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and
morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,
outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment
epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,
while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.
These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory
automation and the transformative role of language-based reasoning in
biological research.

robotic systems with unknown dynamics and prescribed input constraints. The
Euler-Lagrange formulation, a common modeling approach for robotic systems, has
been adopted in this study to address the trade-off between performance and
actuator safety. We establish feasibility conditions that ensure tracking
errors evolve within predefined funnel bounds while maintaining bounded control
efforts, a crucial consideration for robots with limited actuation
capabilities. We propose two approximation-free control strategies for
scenarios where these conditions are violated: one actively corrects the error,
and the other stops further deviation. Finally, we demonstrate the robust
performance and safety of the approach through simulations and experimental
validations. This work represents a significant advancement in funnel-based
control, enhancing its applicability to real-world robotics systems with input
constraints.

                                        <span>  Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as
a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate
effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over
multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the
semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role
structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.
Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks
demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive
prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance
on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration,
leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To
address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked
navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven
semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient
semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a
dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and
personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing
Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors
with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection
strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)
environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY
outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence
speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative
navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

simultaneous time-constrained interception of a stationary target when the
interceptors exchange information over switched dynamic graphs. We specifically
focus on scenarios when the interceptors lack radial acceleration capabilities,
relying solely on their lateral acceleration components. This consideration
aligns with their inherent kinematic turn constraints. The proposed strategy
explicitly addresses the complexities of coupled 3D engagements, thereby
mitigating performance degradation that typically arises when the pitch and yaw
channels are decoupled into two separate, mutually orthogonal planar
engagements. Moreover, our formulation incorporates modeling uncertainties
associated with the time-to-go estimation into the derivation of cooperative
guidance commands to ensure robustness against inaccuracies in dynamic
engagement scenarios. To optimize control efficiency, we analytically derive
the lateral acceleration components in the orthogonal pitch and yaw channels by
solving an instantaneous optimization problem, subject to an affine constraint.
We show that the proposed cooperative guidance commands guarantee consensus in
time-to-go values within a predefined time, which can be prescribed as a design
parameter, regardless of the interceptors' initial configurations. We provide
simulations to attest to the efficacy of the proposed method.

driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed
decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion
prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,
which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic
rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting
model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and
road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of
driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to
merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns
holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.
Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory
usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning
mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and
semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the
limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more
informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and
advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We
verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion
forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while
achieving improved performance.

mobile agents, each with a unique ID and initially located arbitrarily on the
nodes of an $n$-node graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, must autonomously
relocate so that no node hosts more than one agent. Dispersion serves as a
fundamental task in distributed computing of mobile agents, and its complexity
stems from key challenges in local coordination under anonymity and limited
memory.
  The goal is to minimize both the time to achieve dispersion and the memory
required per agent. It is known that any algorithm requires $\Omega(k)$ time in
the worst case, and $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of memory per agent. A recent result
[SPAA'25] gives an optimal $O(k)$-time algorithm in the synchronous setting and
an $O(k \log k)$-time algorithm in the asynchronous setting, both using
$O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits.
  In this paper, we close the complexity gap in the asynchronous setting by
presenting the first dispersion algorithm that runs in optimal $O(k)$ time
using $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits of memory per agent. Our solution is based on a
novel technique we develop in this paper that constructs a port-one tree in
anonymous graphs, which may be of independent interest.

LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their
integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge
encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for
enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational
commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation.
Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations
of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of
the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation
on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system
reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies,
establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.

                                        <span>  Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for
evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code
generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA
simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based
control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical
dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates
safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of
traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge
the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video
generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts
rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables
controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but
critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden
vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical
scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous
vehicles.

over single-vehicle autonomy, traditional infrastructure-based V2X systems
remain constrained by substantial deployment costs and the creation of
"uncovered danger zones" in rural and suburban areas. We present
AirV2X-Perception, a large-scale dataset that leverages Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs) as a flexible alternative or complement to fixed Road-Side

complementary bird's-eye-views that reduce occlusions, dynamic positioning
capabilities that enable hovering, patrolling, and escorting navigation rules,
and significantly lower deployment costs compared to fixed infrastructure. Our
dataset comprises 6.73 hours of drone-assisted driving scenarios across urban,
suburban, and rural environments with varied weather and lighting conditions.
The AirV2X-Perception dataset facilitates the development and standardized
evaluation of Vehicle-to-Drone (V2D) algorithms, addressing a critical gap in
the rapidly expanding field of aerial-assisted autonomous driving systems. The

                                        <span>  With the increasing demand for human-computer interaction (HCI), flexible
wearable gloves have emerged as a promising solution in virtual reality,
medical rehabilitation, and industrial automation. However, the current
technology still has problems like insufficient sensitivity and limited
durability, which hinder its wide application. This paper presents a highly
sensitive, modular, and flexible capacitive sensor based on line-shaped
electrodes and liquid metal (EGaIn), integrated into a sensor module tailored
to the human hand's anatomy. The proposed system independently captures bending
information from each finger joint, while additional measurements between
adjacent fingers enable the recording of subtle variations in inter-finger
spacing. This design enables accurate gesture recognition and dynamic hand
morphological reconstruction of complex movements using point clouds.
Experimental results demonstrate that our classifier based on Convolution
Neural Network (CNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) achieves an accuracy of
99.15% across 30 gestures. Meanwhile, a transformer-based Deep Neural Network
(DNN) accurately reconstructs dynamic hand shapes with an Average Distance (AD)
of 2.076\pm3.231 mm, with the reconstruction accuracy at individual key points
surpassing SOTA benchmarks by 9.7% to 64.9%. The proposed glove shows excellent
accuracy, robustness and scalability in gesture recognition and hand
reconstruction, making it a promising solution for next-generation HCI systems.

computes collision-free paths directly in image space. The generated paths can
then be tracked using vision-based control, eliminating the need for an
explicit robot model or proprioceptive sensing. At the core of our approach is
the construction of a roadmap entirely in image space. To achieve this, we
explicitly define sampling, nearest-neighbor selection, and collision checking
based on visual features rather than geometric models. We first collect a set
of image-space samples by moving the robot within its workspace, capturing
keypoints along its body at different configurations. These samples serve as
nodes in the roadmap, which we construct using either learned or predefined
distance metrics. At runtime, the roadmap generates collision-free paths
directly in image space, removing the need for a robot model or joint encoders.
We validate our approach through an experimental study in which a robotic arm
follows planned paths using an adaptive vision-based control scheme to avoid
obstacles. The results show that paths generated with the learned-distance
roadmap achieved 100% success in control convergence, whereas the predefined
image-space distance roadmap enabled faster transient responses but had a lower
success rate in convergence.

platforms to train machine learning (ML) agents or models with synthetic data
for surgical assistance. While existing platforms excel at tasks such as rigid
body manipulation and soft body deformation, they struggle to simulate more
complex soft body behaviors like cutting and suturing. A key challenge lies in
modeling soft body fracture and splitting using the finite-element method
(FEM), which is the predominant approach in current platforms. Additionally,
the two-way suture needle/thread contact inside a soft body is further
complicated when using FEM. In this work, we use the material point method
(MPM) for such challenging simulations and propose new rigid geometries and
soft-rigid contact methods specifically designed for them. We introduce
CRESSim-MPM, a GPU-accelerated MPM library that integrates multiple MPM solvers
and incorporates surgical geometries for cutting and suturing, serving as a
specialized physics engine for surgical applications. It is further integrated
into Unity, requiring minimal modifications to existing projects for soft body
simulation. We demonstrate the simulator's capabilities in real-time simulation
of cutting and suturing on soft tissue and provide an initial performance
evaluation of different MPM solvers when simulating varying numbers of

                                        <span>  Approximating nonlinear systems as linear ones is a common workaround to
apply control tools tailored for linear systems. This motivates our present
work where we developed a data-driven model predictive controller (MPC) based
on the Koopman operator framework, allowing the embedding of nonlinear dynamics
in a higher dimensional, but linear function space. The controller, termed
adaptive Koopman model predictive control (KMPC), uses online closed-loop
feedback to learn and incrementally update a linear representation of nonlinear
system dynamics, without the prior knowledge of a model. Adaptive KMPC differs
from most other Koopman-based control frameworks that aim to identify
high-validity-range models in advance and then enter closed-loop control
without further model adaptations. To validate the controller, trajectory
tracking experiments are conducted with 1R and 2R robots under force
disturbances and changing model parameters. We compare the controller to
classical linearization MPC and Koopman-based MPC without model updates,
denoted static KMPC. The results show that adaptive KMPC can, opposed to static
KMPC, generalize over unforeseen force disturbances and can, opposed to
linearization MPC, handle varying dynamic parameters, while using a small set
of basis functions to approximate the Koopman operator.

                                        <span>  Multi-robot systems (MRSs) are valuable for tasks such as search and rescue
due to their ability to coordinate over shared observations. A central
challenge in these systems is aligning independently collected perception data
across space and time, i.e., multi-robot data association. While recent
advances in collaborative SLAM (C-SLAM), map merging, and inter-robot loop
closure detection have significantly progressed the field, evaluation
strategies still predominantly rely on splitting a single trajectory from
single-robot SLAM datasets into multiple segments to simulate multiple robots.
Without careful consideration to how a single trajectory is split, this
approach will fail to capture realistic pose-dependent variation in
observations of a scene inherent to multi-robot systems. To address this gap,
we present CU-Multi, a multi-robot dataset collected over multiple days at two
locations on the University of Colorado Boulder campus. Using a single robotic
platform, we generate four synchronized runs with aligned start times and
deliberate percentages of trajectory overlap. CU-Multi includes RGB-D, GPS with
accurate geospatial heading, and semantically annotated LiDAR data. By
introducing controlled variations in trajectory overlap and dense lidar
annotations, CU-Multi offers a compelling alternative for evaluating methods in
multi-robot data association. Instructions on accessing the dataset, support
code, and the latest updates are publicly available at

multi-step goals. Current approaches rely on environment-agnostic imitation
learning that disconnects instructions from environmental contexts, causing
models to struggle with context-sensitive instructions and rely on
supplementary cues rather than visual reasoning during long-horizon

Enhancement (WAP), a framework that infuses LVLMs with comprehensive
environmental understanding through four cognitive capabilities (visual
appearance modeling, spatial reasoning, functional abstraction, and syntactic
grounding) while developing and evaluating models using only raw visual
observations through curriculum learning. Evaluations on the EB-ALFRED
benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL achieving a
60.7 absolute improvement in task success rates, particularly in commonsense
reasoning (+60.0) and long-horizon planning (+70.0). Notably, our enhanced
open-source models outperform proprietary systems like GPT-4o and

                                        <span>  In remote control systems, transmitting large data volumes (e.g., images,
video frames) from wireless sensors to remote controllers is challenging when
uplink capacity is limited (e.g., RedCap devices or massive wireless sensor
networks). Furthermore, controllers often need only information-rich
representations of the original data. To address this, we propose a
semantic-driven predictive control combined with a channel-aware scheduling to
enhance control performance for multiple devices under limited network
capacity. At its core, the proposed framework, coined Time-Series Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture (TS-JEPA), encodes high-dimensional sensory
data into low-dimensional semantic embeddings at the sensor, reducing
communication overhead. Furthermore, TS-JEPA enables predictive inference by
predicting future embeddings from current ones and predicted commands, which
are directly used by a semantic actor model to compute control commands within
the embedding space, eliminating the need to reconstruct raw data. To further
enhance reliability and communication efficiency, a channel-aware scheduling is
integrated to dynamically prioritize device transmissions based on channel
conditions and age of information (AoI). Simulations on inverted cart-pole
systems show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms conventional
control baselines in communication efficiency, control cost, and predictive
accuracy. It enables robust and scalable control under limited network capacity
compared to traditional scheduling schemes.

traffic scenes becomes increasingly difficult due to the multi-modal nature of
agent motion. Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on
forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of
autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for
plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a
novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture
the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road
layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse,
plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models
in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2
dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves
both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further
evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test
setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.

actuation via external magnetic fields, offering remote, rapid, and precise
control, which is highly promising for biomedical applications. However,
designing such systems is challenging due to the complex interplay of
magneto-elastic dynamics, large deformation, solid contacts, time-varying
stimuli, and posture-dependent loading. As a result, most existing research
relies on heuristics and trial-and-error methods or focuses on the independent
design of stimuli or structures under static conditions. We propose a topology
optimization framework for magnetic soft robots that simultaneously designs
structures, location-specific material magnetization and time-varying magnetic
stimuli, accounting for large deformations, dynamic motion, and solid contacts.
This is achieved by integrating generalized topology optimization with the
magneto-elastic material point method, which supports GPU-accelerated parallel
simulations and auto-differentiation for sensitivity analysis. We applied this
framework to design magnetic robots for various tasks, including multi-task
shape morphing and locomotion, in both 2D and 3D. The method autonomously
generates optimized robotic systems to achieve target behaviors without
requiring human intervention. Despite the nonlinear physics and large design
space, it demonstrates high computational efficiency, completing all cases
within minutes. The framework provides a computational foundation for the
autonomous co-design of active soft materials in applications such as
metasurfaces, drug delivery, and minimally invasive procedures.

                                        <span>  This work views the multi-agent system and its surrounding environment as a
co-evolving system, where the behavior of one affects the other. The goal is to
take both agent actions and environment configurations as decision variables,
and optimize these two components in a coordinated manner to improve some
measure of interest. Towards this end, we consider the problem of decentralized
multi-agent navigation in a cluttered environment, where we assume that the
layout of the environment is reconfigurable. By introducing two sub-objectives
-- multi-agent navigation and environment optimization -- we propose an
agent-environment co-optimization problem and develop a coordinated algorithm
that alternates between these sub-objectives to search for an optimal synthesis
of agent actions and environment configurations; ultimately, improving the
navigation performance. Due to the challenge of explicitly modeling the
relation between the agents, the environment and their performance therein, we
leverage policy gradient to formulate a model-free learning mechanism within
the coordinated framework. A formal convergence analysis shows that our
coordinated algorithm tracks the local minimum solution of an associated
time-varying non-convex optimization problem. Experiments corroborate
theoretical findings and show the benefits of co-optimization. Interestingly,
the results also indicate that optimized environments can offer structural
guidance to de-conflict agents in motion.

                                        <span>  3D scene understanding is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and a
key component in enabling mixed reality, wearable computing, and embodied AI.
Providing a solution to these applications requires a multifaceted approach
that covers scene-centric, object-centric, as well as interaction-centric
capabilities. While there exist numerous datasets and algorithms approaching
the former two problems, the task of understanding interactable and articulated
objects is underrepresented and only partly covered in the research field. In
this work, we address this shortcoming by introducing: (1) Articulate3D, an
expertly curated 3D dataset featuring high-quality manual annotations on 280
indoor scenes. Articulate3D provides 8 types of annotations for articulated
objects, covering parts and detailed motion information, all stored in a
standardized scene representation format designed for scalable 3D content
creation, exchange and seamless integration into simulation environments. (2)
USDNet, a novel unified framework capable of simultaneously predicting part
segmentation along with a full specification of motion attributes for
articulated objects. We evaluate USDNet on Articulate3D as well as two existing
datasets, demonstrating the advantage of our unified dense prediction approach.
Furthermore, we highlight the value of Articulate3D through cross-dataset and
cross-domain evaluations and showcase its applicability in downstream tasks
such as scene editing through LLM prompting and robotic policy training for
articulated object manipulation. We provide open access to our dataset,
benchmark, and method's source code.

                                        <span>  This paper presents an algorithm to improve state estimation for legged
robots. Among existing model-based state estimation methods for legged robots,
the contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter defines the state on a Lie
group to preserve invariance, thereby significantly accelerating convergence.
It achieves more accurate state estimation by leveraging contact information as
measurements for the update step. However, when the model exhibits strong
nonlinearity, the estimation accuracy decreases. Such nonlinearities can cause
initial errors to accumulate and lead to large drifts over time. To address
this issue, we propose compensating for errors by augmenting the Kalman filter
with an artificial neural network serving as a nonlinear function approximator.
Furthermore, we design this neural network to respect the Lie group structure
to ensure invariance, resulting in our proposed Invariant Neural-Augmented
Kalman Filter (InNKF). The proposed algorithm offers improved state estimation
performance by combining the strengths of model-based and learning-based
approaches. Project webpage: https://seokju-lee.github.io/innkf_webpage

                                        <span>  Real-world tasks such as garment manipulation and table rearrangement demand
robots to perform generalizable, highly precise, and long-horizon actions.
Although imitation learning has proven to be an effective approach for teaching
robots new skills, large amounts of expert demonstration data are still
indispensible for these complex tasks, resulting in high sample complexity and
costly data collection. To address this, we propose Semantic Keypoint Imitation
Learning (SKIL), a framework which automatically obtains semantic keypoints
with the help of vision foundation models, and forms the descriptor of semantic
keypoints that enables efficient imitation learning of complex robotic tasks
with significantly lower sample complexity. In real-world experiments, SKIL
doubles the performance of baseline methods in tasks such as picking a cup or
mouse, while demonstrating exceptional robustness to variations in objects,
environmental changes, and distractors. For long-horizon tasks like hanging a
towel on a rack where previous methods fail completely, SKIL achieves a mean
success rate of 70\% with as few as 30 demonstrations. Furthermore, SKIL
naturally supports cross-embodiment learning due to its semantic keypoints
abstraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even human videos bring
considerable improvement to the learning performance. All these results
demonstrate the great success of SKIL in achieving data-efficient generalizable
robotic learning. Visualizations and code are available at:

language is crucial to autonomous systems in household services. Conventional
methods can only accomplish human instructions in the known environment where
all interactive objects are provided to the embodied agent, and directly
deploying the existing approaches for the unknown environment usually generates
infeasible plans that manipulate non-existing objects. On the contrary, we
propose an embodied instruction following (EIF) method for complex tasks in the
unknown environment, where the agent efficiently explores the unknown
environment to generate feasible plans with existing objects to accomplish
abstract instructions. Specifically, we build a hierarchical embodied
instruction following framework including the high-level task planner and the
low-level exploration controller with multimodal large language models. We then
construct a semantic representation map of the scene with dynamic region
attention to demonstrate the known visual clues, where the goal of task
planning and scene exploration is aligned for human instruction. For the task
planner, we generate the feasible step-by-step plans for human goal
accomplishment according to the task completion process and the known visual
clues. For the exploration controller, the optimal navigation or object
interaction policy is predicted based on the generated step-wise plans and the
known visual clues. The experimental results demonstrate that our method can
achieve 45.09% success rate in 204 complex human instructions such as making
breakfast and tidying rooms in large house-level scenes. Code and supplementary

detection to handle variable input frame numbers in practical scenarios.
Existing methods only consider fixed frames of input data for a single
detector, such as monocular RGB-D images or point clouds reconstructed from
dense multi-view RGB-D images. While in practical application scenes such as
robot navigation and manipulation, the raw input to the 3D detectors is the
RGB-D images with variable frame numbers instead of the reconstructed scene
point cloud. However, the previous approaches can only handle fixed frame input
data and have poor performance with variable frame input. In order to
facilitate 3D object detection methods suitable for practical tasks, we present
a novel 3D detection framework named AnyView for our practical applications,
which generalizes well across different numbers of input frames with a single
model. To be specific, we propose a geometric learner to mine the local
geometric features of each input RGB-D image frame and implement local-global
feature interaction through a designed spatial mixture module. Meanwhile, we
further utilize a dynamic token strategy to adaptively adjust the number of
extracted features for each frame, which ensures consistent global feature
density and further enhances the generalization after fusion. Extensive
experiments on the ScanNet dataset show our method achieves both great
generalizability and high detection accuracy with a simple and clean
architecture containing a similar amount of parameters with the baselines.

                                        <span>  Handover between a human and a dexterous robotic hand is a fundamental yet
challenging task in human-robot collaboration. It requires handling dynamic
environments and a wide variety of objects and demands robust and adaptive
grasping strategies. However, progress in developing effective dynamic
dexterous grasping methods is limited by the absence of high-quality,
real-world human-to-robot handover datasets. Existing datasets primarily focus
on grasping static objects or rely on synthesized handover motions, which
differ significantly from real-world robot motion patterns, creating a
substantial gap in applicability. In this paper, we introduce DexH2R, a
comprehensive real-world dataset for human-to-robot handovers, built on a
dexterous robotic hand. Our dataset captures a diverse range of interactive
objects, dynamic motion patterns, rich visual sensor data, and detailed
annotations. Additionally, to ensure natural and human-like dexterous motions,
we utilize teleoperation for data collection, enabling the robot's movements to
align with human behaviors and habits, which is a crucial characteristic for
intelligent humanoid robots. Furthermore, we propose an effective solution,
DynamicGrasp, for human-to-robot handover and evaluate various state-of-the-art
approaches, including auto-regressive models and diffusion policy methods,
providing a thorough comparison and analysis. We believe our benchmark will
drive advancements in human-to-robot handover research by offering a
high-quality dataset, effective solutions, and comprehensive evaluation
metrics.

                                        <span>  High-precision tiny object alignment remains a common and critical challenge
for humanoid robots in real-world. To address this problem, this paper proposes
a vision-based framework for precisely estimating and controlling the relative
position between a handheld tool and a target object for humanoid robots, e.g.,
a screwdriver tip and a screw head slot. By fusing images from the head and
torso cameras on a robot with its head joint angles, the proposed
Transformer-based visual servoing method can correct the handheld tool's
positional errors effectively, especially at a close distance. Experiments on
M4-M8 screws demonstrate an average convergence error of 0.8-1.3 mm and a
success rate of 93\%-100\%. Through comparative analysis, the results validate
that this capability of high-precision tiny object alignment is enabled by the
Distance Estimation Transformer architecture and the Multi-Perception-Head
mechanism proposed in this paper.

robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and
deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model
named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information
(foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between
robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its
adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or
transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural
adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg
kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of
this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to
retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real
experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy
beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain,
and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of
asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed
that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics
model} outperforms state-of-the-art works. Our project page is available for

                                        <span>  We introduce real-is-sim, a new approach to integrating simulation into
behavior cloning pipelines. In contrast to real-only methods, which lack the
ability to safely test policies before deployment, and sim-to-real methods,
which require complex adaptation to cross the sim-to-real gap, our framework
allows policies to seamlessly switch between running on real hardware and
running in parallelized virtual environments. At the center of real-is-sim is a
dynamic digital twin, powered by the Embodied Gaussian simulator, that
synchronizes with the real world at 60Hz. This twin acts as a mediator between
the behavior cloning policy and the real robot. Policies are trained using
representations derived from simulator states and always act on the simulated
robot, never the real one. During deployment, the real robot simply follows the
simulated robot's joint states, and the simulation is continuously corrected
with real world measurements. This setup, where the simulator drives all policy
execution and maintains real-time synchronization with the physical world,
shifts the responsibility of crossing the sim-to-real gap to the digital twin's
synchronization mechanisms, instead of the policy itself. We demonstrate
real-is-sim on a long-horizon manipulation task (PushT), showing that virtual
evaluations are consistent with real-world results. We further show how
real-world data can be augmented with virtual rollouts and compare to policies
trained on different representations derived from the simulator state including
object poses and rendered images from both static and robot-mounted cameras.
Our results highlight the flexibility of the real-is-sim framework across
training, evaluation, and deployment stages. Videos available at

emergence of neural implicit representations has introduced significant
advances to these domains, enabling numerous novel capabilities. Among these,
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained considerable attention because of
their considerable representational advantages, such as simplified mathematical

to computer vision, NeRFs have demonstrated significant potential in robotics.
Thus, we present this survey to provide a comprehensive understanding of NeRFs
in the field of robotics. By exploring the advantages and limitations of NeRF
as well as its current applications and future potential, we aim to provide an
overview of this promising area of research. Our survey is divided into two
main sections: \textit{Applications of NeRFs in Robotics} and \textit{Advances
for NeRFs in Robotics}, from the perspective of how NeRF enters the field of
robotics. In the first section, we introduce and analyze some works that have
been or could be used in robotics for perception and interaction tasks. In the
second section, we show some works related to improving NeRF's own properties,
which are essential for deploying NeRFs in robotics. In the discussion section
of the review, we summarize the existing challenges and provide valuable future
research directions.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped
robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to
simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due
to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address
this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving
priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple
stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors
through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER
progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration
and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or
handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured
three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation
space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust
monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the
resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional
methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly
spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.
JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing
locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains.

                                        <span>  As modern computing advances, new interaction paradigms have emerged,
particularly in Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays virtual interfaces onto
physical objects. This evolution poses challenges in machine perception,
especially for tasks like 3D object pose estimation in complex, dynamic
environments. Our project addresses critical issues in human-robot interaction
within mobile AR, focusing on non-intrusive, spatially aware interfaces. We
present URSA, an LLM-driven immersive AR system developed for NASA's 2023-2024
SUITS challenge, targeting future spaceflight needs such as the Artemis
missions. URSA integrates three core technologies: a head-mounted AR device
(e.g., HoloLens) for intuitive visual feedback, voice control powered by large
language models for hands-free interaction, and robot tracking algorithms that
enable accurate 3D localization in dynamic settings. To enhance precision, we
leverage digital twin localization technologies, using datasets like
DTTD-Mobile and specialized hardware such as the ZED2 camera for real-world
tracking under noise and occlusion. Our system enables real-time robot control
and monitoring via an AR interface, even in the absence of ground-truth
sensors--vital for hazardous or remote operations. Key contributions include:
(1) a non-intrusive AR interface with LLM-based voice input; (2) a ZED2-based
dataset tailored for non-rigid robotic bodies; (3) a Local Mission Control
Console (LMCC) for mission visualization; (4) a transformer-based 6DoF pose
estimator (DTTDNet) optimized for depth fusion and real-time tracking; and (5)
end-to-end integration for astronaut mission support. This work advances
digital twin applications in robotics, offering scalable solutions for both
aerospace and industrial domains.

                                        <span>  This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that
combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core
contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free
configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph
search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space,
burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to
fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid
path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within
the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated
through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying
number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results
demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in
complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving
comparable performance in simpler scenarios.

                                        <span>  In many robotics applications, it is necessary to compute not only the
distance between the robot and the environment, but also its derivative - for
example, when using control barrier functions. However, since the traditional
Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative
distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed
differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks,
which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical
expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes.
Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the
objects overlap. We show the efficacy of the approach in experimental results.
Our proposed distance metric is publicly available through the Python-based
simulation package UAIBot.

integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to achieve robust performance under
various unknown perturbations. Traditional control techniques often rely on
precise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external
perturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based
expert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator
failures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous
results in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner
policy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs
and improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary
experiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert
can rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna
orientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,
the GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories
generated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping. The
integration of GAIL further reduces sample complexity and demonstrates
promising imitation capabilities, paving the way for more intelligent and
autonomous spacecraft control systems.

real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic
ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and
improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential
for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy
reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack
of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We
introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic
ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of
environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US
data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and
a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent
IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in
robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and
orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent
method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and
safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful
policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the
limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe
our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such
challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are

perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery
noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate
robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While
existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address
general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or
the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by
offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep
learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and
subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks
(NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural
networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and
training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored.
Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to
facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific
contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general,
regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific
implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies
in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable
roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for
next-generation robots.

                                        <span>  We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task
Awareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative
trajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task
completion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., "find a
person"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the
object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its
environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic
similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment.
To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient
viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view
diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage
metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in
computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware
experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps,
compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less
challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying
it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

                                        <span>  Current control strategies for powered lower limb prostheses often lack
awareness of the environment and the user's intended interactions with it. This
limitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle
negotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both
real-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention
about when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing
trajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental
awareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles
ahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure
clearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from
the user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring
unnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants
demonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30
step-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and
distances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a
gateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates
adaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with
promising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios.

                                        <span>  Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

                                        <span>  In this paper, we introduce an innovative vector quantization based action
tokenizer built upon the largest-scale action trajectory dataset to date,
leveraging over 100 times more data than previous approaches. This extensive
dataset enables our tokenizer to capture rich spatiotemporal dynamics,
resulting in a model that not only accelerates inference but also generates
smoother and more coherent action outputs. Once trained, the tokenizer can be
seamlessly adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner,
from short-horizon reactive behaviors to long-horizon planning. A key finding
of our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action
trajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of
synthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To
validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated
environments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the
volume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer
on downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%
higher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and
scalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way
for more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application
domains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io

that enables robots to perform complex manipulation tasks--such as pouring,
wiping, and mixing--purely by imitating AI-generated videos, without requiring
any physical demonstrations or robot-specific training. Given a language
command and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential
demonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters
out results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts
object trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the
robot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world
evaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real
demonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also
show that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives
such as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking
outperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point
tracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art
off-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic
manipulation.

generate vast amounts of data -- most of which remains unannotated. This paper
develops a self-supervised domain adaptation pipeline that leverages
real-world, unlabeled data to improve perception models without requiring
manual annotations. Our work focuses specifically on estimating the pose and
shape of boxes and presents a correct-and-certify pipeline for self-supervised
box pose and shape estimation. We extensively evaluate our approach across a
range of simulated and real industrial settings, including adaptation to a
large-scale real-world dataset of 50,000 images. The self-supervised model
significantly outperforms models trained solely in simulation and shows
substantial improvements over a zero-shot 3D bounding box estimation baseline.

                                        <span>  As social robots increasingly enter dementia care, concerns about deception,
intentional or not, are gaining attention. Yet, how robotic design cues might
elicit misleading perceptions in people with dementia, and how these
perceptions arise, remains insufficiently understood. In this scoping review,
we examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia
and physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may
influence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,
simulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar
beings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that
reveal artificiality. Thematic analysis of user responses reveals that people
with dementia often attribute biological, social, and mental capacities to
robots, dynamically shifting between awareness and illusion. These findings
underscore the fluctuating nature of ontological perception in dementia
contexts. Existing definitions of robotic deception often rest on philosophical
or behaviorist premises, but rarely engage with the cognitive mechanisms
involved. We propose an empirically grounded definition: robotic deception
occurs when Type 1 (automatic, heuristic) processing dominates over Type 2
(deliberative, analytic) reasoning, leading to misinterpretation of a robot's
artificial nature. This dual-process perspective highlights the ethical
complexity of social robots in dementia care and calls for design approaches
that are not only engaging, but also epistemically respectful.

adoption of automation in homes and commercial spaces. However, existing lidar
and camera-based solutions have limitations such as poor performance in
visually obscured environments, high computational overhead for data
processing, and high costs for lidars. In contrast, mmWave radar sensors offer
a cost-effective and lightweight alternative, providing accurate ranging
regardless of visibility. However, existing radar-based localization suffers
from sparse point cloud generation, noise, and false detections. Thus, in this
work, we introduce RaGNNarok, a real-time, lightweight, and generalizable graph
neural network (GNN)-based framework to enhance radar point clouds, even in
complex and dynamic environments. With an inference time of just 7.3 ms on the
low-cost Raspberry Pi 5, RaGNNarok runs efficiently even on such
resource-constrained devices, requiring no additional computational resources.
We evaluate its performance across key tasks, including localization, SLAM, and
autonomous navigation, in three different environments. Our results demonstrate
strong reliability and generalizability, making RaGNNarok a robust solution for
low-cost indoor mobile robots.

                                        <span>  The pursuit of artificial general intelligence (AGI) has placed embodied
intelligence at the forefront of robotics research. Embodied intelligence
focuses on agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting within the
physical world. Achieving robust embodied intelligence requires not only
advanced perception and control, but also the ability to ground abstract
cognition in real-world interactions. Two foundational technologies, physical
simulators and world models, have emerged as critical enablers in this quest.
Physical simulators provide controlled, high-fidelity environments for training
and evaluating robotic agents, allowing safe and efficient development of
complex behaviors. In contrast, world models empower robots with internal
representations of their surroundings, enabling predictive planning and
adaptive decision-making beyond direct sensory input. This survey
systematically reviews recent advances in learning embodied AI through the
integration of physical simulators and world models. We analyze their
complementary roles in enhancing autonomy, adaptability, and generalization in
intelligent robots, and discuss the interplay between external simulation and
internal modeling in bridging the gap between simulated training and real-world
deployment. By synthesizing current progress and identifying open challenges,
this survey aims to provide a comprehensive perspective on the path toward more
capable and generalizable embodied AI systems. We also maintain an active
repository that contains up-to-date literature and open-source projects at

understanding is a fast-growing frontier, driving the development of 3D
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Current methods show strong dependence on object
detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic
flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM
for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene
representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the
3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive,
achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense
representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into
compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways,
producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present
the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D
representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong
generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in
out-of-the-domain settings.

navigation of outdoor robots operating in complex environments. This paper
introduces a novel experience-based method that allows robots to autonomously
learn which terrains are traversable based on prior navigation experience,
without relying on extensive pre-labeled datasets. The approach integrates
elevation and texture data into multi-layered grid maps, which are processed
using a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained on a generic texture dataset.
During an initial teleoperated phase, the robot collects sensory data while
moving around the environment. These experiences are encoded into compact
feature vectors and clustered using the BIRCH algorithm to represent
traversable terrain areas efficiently. In deployment, the robot compares new
terrain patches to its learned feature clusters to assess traversability in
real time. The proposed method does not require training with data from the
targeted scenarios, generalizes across diverse surfaces and platforms, and
dynamically adapts as new terrains are encountered. Extensive evaluations on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world scenarios with wheeled and legged
robots demonstrate its effectiveness, robustness, and superior adaptability
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

                                        <span>  For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation
benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid
robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and
high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous
manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm
movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging.
This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration
collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM
reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial
annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations,
and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial
constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To
further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree
search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient
annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented
scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that
the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the
generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.

                                        <span>  Accurate dynamics modeling is essential for quadrotors to achieve precise
trajectory tracking in various applications. Traditional physical
knowledge-driven modeling methods face substantial limitations in unknown
environments characterized by variable payloads, wind disturbances, and
external perturbations. On the other hand, data-driven modeling methods suffer
from poor generalization when handling out-of-distribution (OoD) data,
restricting their effectiveness in unknown scenarios. To address these
challenges, we introduce the Physics-Informed Wind-Adaptive Network (PI-WAN),
which combines knowledge-driven and data-driven modeling methods by embedding
physical constraints directly into the training process for robust quadrotor
dynamics learning. Specifically, PI-WAN employs a Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) architecture that efficiently captures temporal dependencies from
historical flight data, while a physics-informed loss function applies physical
principles to improve model generalization and robustness across previously
unseen conditions. By incorporating real-time prediction results into a model
predictive control (MPC) framework, we achieve improvements in closed-loop
tracking performance. Comprehensive simulations and real-world flight
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods in terms
of prediction accuracy, tracking precision, and robustness to unknown
environments.

                                        <span>  Human-object interaction segmentation is a fundamental task of daily activity
understanding, which plays a crucial role in applications such as assistive
robotics, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Most existing learning-based
methods excel in closed-world action segmentation, they struggle to generalize
to open-world scenarios where novel actions emerge. Collecting exhaustive
action categories for training is impractical due to the dynamic diversity of
human activities, necessitating models that detect and segment
out-of-distribution actions without manual annotation. To address this issue,
we formally define the open-world action segmentation problem and propose a
structured framework for detecting and segmenting unseen actions. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: 1) an Enhanced Pyramid Graph Convolutional
Network (EPGCN) with a novel decoder module for robust spatiotemporal feature
upsampling. 2) Mixup-based training to synthesize out-of-distribution data,
eliminating reliance on manual annotations. 3) A novel Temporal Clustering loss
that groups in-distribution actions while distancing out-of-distribution
samples.
  We evaluate our framework on two challenging human-object interaction
recognition datasets: Bimanual Actions and 2 Hands and Object (H2O) datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art
action segmentation models across multiple open-set evaluation metrics,
achieving 16.9% and 34.6% relative gains in open-set segmentation (F1@50) and
out-of-distribution detection performances (AUROC), respectively. Additionally,
we conduct an in-depth ablation study to assess the impact of each proposed
component, identifying the optimal framework configuration for open-world
action segmentation.

                                        <span>  Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent
robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity
labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise
in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to
over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To
address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that
integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g.,
30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation.
Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding
strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to
enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion
module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via
hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions
inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation
technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training
examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in
predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts.
  Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for
human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation
accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.

unstructured real-world animal motion data to generate animal-like and
user-steerable behaviors. Our framework learns to follow velocity commands
while reproducing the diverse gait patterns in the original dataset. To begin
with, animal motion data is transformed into a robot-compatible database using
constrained inverse kinematics and model predictive control, bridging the
morphological and physical gap between the animal and the robot. Subsequently,
a variational autoencoder-based motion synthesis module captures the diverse
locomotion patterns in the motion database and generates smooth transitions
between them in response to velocity commands. The resulting kinematic motions
serve as references for a reinforcement learning-based feedback controller
deployed on physical robots. We show that this approach enables a quadruped
robot to adaptively switch gaits and accurately track user velocity commands
while maintaining the stylistic coherence of the motion data. Additionally, we
provide component-wise evaluations to analyze the system's behavior in depth
and demonstrate the efficacy of our method for more accurate and reliable
motion imitation.

clouds based on natural language. While prior work has made strides using
textual descriptions, leveraging spoken language-known as Audio-based 3D Visual
Grounding-remains underexplored and challenging. Motivated by advances in
automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speech representation learning, we
propose Audio-3DVG, a simple yet effective framework that integrates audio and
spatial information for enhanced grounding. Rather than treating speech as a
monolithic input, we decompose the task into two complementary components.
First, we introduce Object Mention Detection, a multi-label classification task
that explicitly identifies which objects are referred to in the audio, enabling
more structured audio-scene reasoning. Second, we propose an Audio-Guided
Attention module that captures interactions between candidate objects and
relational speech cues, improving target discrimination in cluttered scenes. To
support benchmarking, we synthesize audio descriptions for standard 3DVG
datasets, including ScanRefer, Sr3D, and Nr3D. Experimental results demonstrate
that Audio-3DVG not only achieves new state-of-the-art performance in
audio-based grounding, but also competes with text-based methods-highlighting
the promise of integrating spoken language into 3D vision tasks.

                                        <span>  In robotics, structural design and behavior optimization have long been
considered separate processes, resulting in the development of systems with
limited capabilities. Recently, co-design methods have gained popularity, where
bi-level formulations are used to simultaneously optimize the robot design and
behavior for specific tasks. However, most implementations assume a serial or
tree-type model of the robot, overlooking the fact that many robot platforms
incorporate parallel mechanisms. In this paper, we present a novel co-design
approach that explicitly incorporates parallel coupling constraints into the
dynamic model of the robot. In this framework, an outer optimization loop
focuses on the design parameters, in our case the transmission ratios of a
parallel belt-driven manipulator, which map the desired torques from the joint
space to the actuation space. An inner loop performs trajectory optimization in
the actuation space, thus exploiting the entire dynamic range of the
manipulator. We compare the proposed method with a conventional co-design
approach based on a simplified tree-type model. By taking advantage of the
actuation space representation, our approach leads to a significant increase in
dynamic payload capacity compared to the conventional co-design implementation.

the natural hand tremors of human surgeons, enabling delicate operations in
confined surgical spaces. Despite the advancements in developing vision- and
force-based control methods for surgical robots, preoperative navigation
remains heavily reliant on manual operation, limiting the consistency and
increasing the uncertainty. Existing eye gaze estimation techniques in the
surgery, whether traditional or deep learning-based, face challenges including
dependence on additional sensors, occlusion issues in surgical environments,
and the requirement for facial detection. To address these limitations, this
study proposes an innovative eye localization and tracking method that combines
machine learning with traditional algorithms, eliminating the requirements of
landmarks and maintaining stable iris detection and gaze estimation under
varying lighting and shadow conditions. Extensive real-world experiment results
show that our proposed method has an average estimation error of 0.58 degrees
for eye orientation estimation and 2.08-degree average control error for the
robotic arm's movement based on the calculated orientation.

                                        <span>  Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) provides a way to learn
high-performance policies in environments where the reward signal is hard to
specify, avoiding heuristic and time-consuming reward design. However, PbRL can
suffer from slow convergence speed since it requires training in a reward
model. Prior work has proposed learning a reward model from demonstrations and
fine-tuning it using preferences. However, when the model is a neural network,
using different loss functions for pre-training and fine-tuning can pose
challenges to reliable optimization. In this paper, we propose a method to
effectively leverage prior knowledge with a Residual Reward Model (RRM). An RRM
assumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two
parts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term
available before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward
function, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning
(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce
state-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks
in the Meta-World environment suite. Experimental results show that our method
substantially improves the performance of a common PbRL method. Our method
achieves performance improvements for a variety of different types of prior
rewards, including proxy rewards, a reward obtained from IRL, and even a
negated version of the proxy reward. We also conduct experiments with a Franka
Panda to show that our method leads to superior performance on a real robot. It
significantly accelerates policy learning for different tasks, achieving
success in fewer steps than the baseline. The videos are presented at

                                        <span>  The deployment of autonomous mobile robots is predicated on the availability
of environmental maps, yet conventional generation via SLAM (Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping) suffers from significant limitations in time, labor,
and robustness, particularly in dynamic, large-scale indoor environments where
map obsolescence can lead to critical localization failures. To address these
challenges, this paper presents a complete and automated system for converting
architectural Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files into a hierarchical topometric
OpenStreetMap (OSM) representation, tailored for robust life-long robot
navigation. Our core methodology involves a multi-stage pipeline that first
isolates key structural layers from the raw CAD data and then employs an
AreaGraph-based topological segmentation to partition the building layout into
a hierarchical graph of navigable spaces. This process yields a comprehensive
and semantically rich map, further enhanced by automatically associating
textual labels from the CAD source and cohesively merging multiple building
floors into a unified, topologically-correct model. By leveraging the permanent
structural information inherent in CAD files, our system circumvents the
inefficiencies and fragility of SLAM, offering a practical and scalable
solution for deploying robots in complex indoor spaces. The software is
encapsulated within an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to facilitate
practical use. The code and dataset are available at

highlighting important work in the domain of edge robotics, examining recent

designed for compact tendon-driven grippers and robotic hands. The proposed
sensor has a small form factor of 13~mm x 7~mm x 6.5~mm and is capable of
measuring tensile forces up to 200~N. A symmetric elastomer structure
incorporating fillets and flexure hinges is designed based on Timoshenko beam
theory and verified via FEM analysis, enabling improved sensitivity and
mechanical durability while minimizing torsional deformation. The sensor
utilizes a compact photo-reflector (VCNT2020) to measure displacement in the
near-field region, eliminating the need for light-absorbing materials or
geometric modifications required in photo-interrupter-based designs. A 16-bit
analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and CAN-FD (Flexible Data-rate) communication
enable efficient signal acquisition with up to 5~kHz sampling rate. Calibration
experiments demonstrate a resolution of 9.9~mN (corresponding to over 14-bit
accuracy) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.455~N. Force control
experiments using a twisted string actuator and PI control yield RMSEs as low
as 0.073~N. Compared to previous research using photo-interrupter, the proposed
method achieves more than tenfold improvement in resolution while also reducing
nonlinearity and hysteresis. The design is mechanically simple, lightweight,
easy to assemble, and suitable for integration into robotic and prosthetic
systems requiring high-resolution force feedback.

propose DIJE, an algorithm to estimate the image Jacobian for every pixel. It
is based on an optical flow calculation and a simplified Kalman Filter that can
be efficiently run on the whole image in real time. It does not rely on markers
nor knowledge of the robotic structure. We use the DIJE in a self-recognition
process which can robustly distinguish between movement by the robot and by
external entities, even when the motion overlaps. We also propose a visual
servoing controller based on DIJE, which can learn to control the robot's body
to conduct reaching movements or bimanual tool-tip control. The proposed
algorithms were implemented on a physical musculoskeletal robot and its
performance was verified. We believe that such global estimation of the
visuomotor policy has the potential to be extended into a more general
framework for manipulation.

                                        <span>  Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a
rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas, which
are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Inspired
by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeons, the focus of the
presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free
formation control for a multi-UAV system, considering the obstacle avoidance
maneuvers. The developed framework in this study utilizes a semi-distributed
control approach, in which, based on a probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, a
centralized guidance algorithm works for optimal positioning of the UAVs, while
a distributed control approach has been used for the intervehicle collision and
obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the
3D space with a novel definition of 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented
framework has been applied to multi-UAV systems in 2D and 3D scenarios, and the
obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in dynamic
environments with stationary and moving obstacles.

                                        <span>  We present RoboEval, a simulation benchmark and structured evaluation
framework designed to reveal the limitations of current bimanual manipulation
policies. While prior benchmarks report only binary task success, we show that
such metrics often conceal critical weaknesses in policy behavior -- such as
poor coordination, slipping during grasping, or asymmetric arm usage. RoboEval
introduces a suite of tiered, semantically grounded tasks decomposed into
skill-specific stages, with variations that systematically challenge spatial,
physical, and coordination capabilities. Tasks are paired with fine-grained
diagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation
learning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates
diverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with
temporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics
correlate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain
informative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how
policies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of
robotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go
beyond success alone.

                                        <span>  Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for
enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the
real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale text
pretraining. However, VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding
capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D
supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated
explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates
additional depth sensors or defective estimation. In contrast, our work
introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly injects 3D geometry features
into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation
models. We design five spatially challenging tasks that require precise spatial
understanding ability to validate effectiveness of our method. Extensive
evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

                                        <span>  When interacting with objects, humans effectively reason about which regions
of objects are viable for an intended action, i.e., the affordance regions of
the object. They can also account for subtle differences in object regions
based on the task to be performed and whether one or two hands need to be used.
However, current vision-based affordance prediction methods often reduce the
problem to naive object part segmentation. In this work, we propose a framework
for extracting affordance data from human activity video datasets. Our
extracted 2HANDS dataset contains precise object affordance region
segmentations and affordance class-labels as narrations of the activity
performed. The data also accounts for bimanual actions, i.e., two hands
co-ordinating and interacting with one or more objects. We present a VLM-based
affordance prediction model, 2HandedAfforder, trained on the dataset and
demonstrate superior performance over baselines in affordance region
segmentation for various activities. Finally, we show that our predicted
affordance regions are actionable, i.e., can be used by an agent performing a
task, through demonstration in robotic manipulation scenarios. Project-website:

is designed to achieve tightly coupled simultaneous locomotion and dexterous
grasping. While existing quadrupedal-limbed robots have demonstrated impressive
dexterous capabilities, achieving a balance between power-demanding locomotion
and precise grasping remains a critical challenge. We design a torso mechanism
and a parallel-serial limb to meet the conflicting requirements that pose
unique challenges in hardware design. SCALER employs underactuated two-fingered
GOAT grippers that can mechanically adapt and offer seven modes of grasping,
enabling SCALER to traverse extreme terrains with multi-modal grasping
strategies. We study the whole-body approach, where SCALER utilizes its body
and limbs to generate additional forces for stable grasping in various
environments, thereby further enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we
improve the GOAT gripper actuation speed to realize more dynamic climbing in a
closed-loop control fashion. With these proposed technologies, SCALER can
traverse vertical, overhanging, upside-down, slippery terrains and bouldering
walls with non-convex-shaped climbing holds under the Earth's gravity.

look-ahead control that enables intuitive, steerable, and physically realistic
motion generation. While existing kinematics motion generation with diffusion
models offer intuitive steering capabilities with inference-time conditioning,
they often fail to produce physically viable motions. In contrast, recent
diffusion-based control policies have shown promise in generating physically
realizable motion sequences, but the lack of kinematics prediction limits their
steerability. Diffuse-CLoC addresses these challenges through a key insight:
modeling the joint distribution of states and actions within a single diffusion
model makes action generation steerable by conditioning it on the predicted
states. This approach allows us to leverage established conditioning techniques
from kinematic motion generation while producing physically realistic motions.
As a result, we achieve planning capabilities without the need for a high-level
planner. Our method handles a diverse set of unseen long-horizon downstream
tasks through a single pre-trained model, including static and dynamic obstacle
avoidance, motion in-betweening, and task-space control. Experimental results

                                        <span>  3D world models (i.e., learning-based 3D dynamics models) offer a promising
approach to generalizable robotic manipulation by capturing the underlying
physics of environment evolution conditioned on robot actions. However,
existing 3D world models are primarily limited to single-material dynamics
using a particle-based Graph Neural Network model, and often require
time-consuming 3D scene reconstruction to obtain 3D particle tracks for
training. In this work, we present ParticleFormer, a Transformer-based point
cloud world model trained with a hybrid point cloud reconstruction loss,
supervising both global and local dynamics features in multi-material,
multi-object robot interactions. ParticleFormer captures fine-grained
multi-object interactions between rigid, deformable, and flexible materials,
trained directly from real-world robot perception data without an elaborate
scene reconstruction. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness both in 3D scene
forecasting tasks, and in downstream manipulation tasks using a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) policy. In addition, we extend existing dynamics
learning benchmarks to include diverse multi-material, multi-object interaction
scenarios. We validate our method on six simulation and three real-world
experiments, where it consistently outperforms leading baselines by achieving
superior dynamics prediction accuracy and less rollout error in downstream
visuomotor tasks. Experimental videos are available at

                                        <span>  Optimal collision-free formation control of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
is a challenge. The state-of-the-art optimal control approaches often rely on
numerical methods sensitive to initial guesses. This paper presents an
innovative collision-free finite-time formation control scheme for multiple
UAVs leveraging the differential flatness of the UAV dynamics, eliminating the
need for numerical methods. We formulate a finite-time optimal control problem
to plan a formation trajectory for feasible initial states. This optimal
control problem in formation trajectory planning involves a collective
performance index to meet the formation requirements to achieve relative
positions and velocity consensus. It is solved by applying Pontryagin's
principle. Subsequently, a collision-constrained regulating problem is
addressed to ensure collision-free tracking of the planned formation
trajectory. The tracking problem incorporates a directionally aware collision
avoidance strategy that prioritizes avoiding UAVs in the forward path and
relative approach. It assigns lower priority to those on the sides with an
oblique relative approach, disregarding UAVs behind and not in the relative
approach. The high-fidelity simulation results validate the effectiveness of
the proposed control scheme.

to both hydraulic and pneumatic actuation systems. A Jacobian-based formulation
maps actuator inputs to joint and task-space responses. Hydraulic actuators are

described using nonlinear pressure-volume relations. The framework enables
consistent evaluation of manipulability ellipsoids and compliance matrices
across actuation modes. We validate the analysis using two representative

actuation-dependent trade-offs in dexterity and passive stiffness. These

                                        <span>  Automating bone micro-milling using a robotic system presents challenges due
to the uncertainties in both the external and internal features of bone tissue.
For example, during mouse cranial window creation, a circular path with a
radius of 2 to 4 mm needs to be milled on the mouse skull using a microdrill.
The uneven surface and non-uniform thickness of the mouse skull make it
difficult to fully automate this process, requiring the system to possess
advanced perceptual and adaptive capabilities. In this study, we address this
challenge by integrating a Microscopic Stereo Camera System (MSCS) into the
robotic bone micro-milling system and proposing a novel pre-measurement
pipeline for the target surface. Starting from uncalibrated cameras, the
pipeline enables automatic calibration and 3D surface fitting through a
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based keypoint detection. Combined with the
existing feedback-based system, we develop the world's first autonomous robotic
bone micro-milling system capable of rapidly, in real-time, and accurately
perceiving and adapting to surface unevenness and non-uniform thickness,
thereby enabling an end-to-end autonomous cranial window creation workflow
without human assistance. Validation experiments on euthanized mice demonstrate
that the improved system achieves a success rate of 85.7% and an average
milling time of 2.1 minutes, showing not only significant performance
improvements over the previous system but also exceptional accuracy, speed, and
stability compared to human operators.

                                        <span>  Imitation learning models for robotic tasks typically rely on multi-modal
inputs, such as RGB images, language, and proprioceptive states. While
proprioception is intuitively important for decision-making and obstacle
avoidance, simply incorporating all proprioceptive states leads to a surprising
degradation in imitation learning performance. In this work, we identify the
underlying issue as the proprioception shift problem, where the distributions
of proprioceptive states diverge significantly between training and deployment.
To address this challenge, we propose a domain adaptation framework that
bridges the gap by utilizing rollout data collected during deployment. Using
Wasserstein distance, we quantify the discrepancy between expert and rollout
proprioceptive states and minimize this gap by adding noise to both sets of
states, proportional to the Wasserstein distance. This strategy enhances
robustness against proprioception shifts by aligning the training and
deployment distributions. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate
the efficacy of our method, enabling the imitation policy to leverage
proprioception while mitigating its adverse effects. Our approach outperforms
the naive solution which discards proprioception, and other baselines designed
to address distributional shifts.

                                        <span>  Multi-agent collaborative perception enhances each agent perceptual
capabilities by sharing sensing information to cooperatively perform robot
perception tasks. This approach has proven effective in addressing challenges
such as sensor deficiencies, occlusions, and long-range perception. However,
existing representative collaborative perception systems transmit intermediate
feature maps, such as bird-eye view (BEV) representations, which contain a
significant amount of non-critical information, leading to high communication
bandwidth requirements. To enhance communication efficiency while preserving
perception capability, we introduce CoCMT, an object-query-based collaboration
framework that optimizes communication bandwidth by selectively extracting and
transmitting essential features. Within CoCMT, we introduce the Efficient Query
Transformer (EQFormer) to effectively fuse multi-agent object queries and
implement a synergistic deep supervision to enhance the positive reinforcement
between stages, leading to improved overall performance. Experiments on OPV2V
and V2V4Real datasets show CoCMT outperforms state-of-the-art methods while
drastically reducing communication needs. On V2V4Real, our model (Top-50 object
queries) requires only 0.416 Mb bandwidth, 83 times less than SOTA methods,
while improving AP70 by 1.1 percent. This efficiency breakthrough enables
practical collaborative perception deployment in bandwidth-constrained
environments without sacrificing detection accuracy.

                                        <span>  Automated waterway environment perception is crucial for enabling unmanned
surface vessels (USVs) to understand their surroundings and make informed
decisions. Most existing waterway perception models primarily focus on
instance-level object perception paradigms (e.g., detection, segmentation).
However, due to the complexity of waterway environments, current perception
datasets and models fail to achieve global semantic understanding of waterways,
limiting large-scale monitoring and structured log generation. With the
advancement of vision-language models (VLMs), we leverage image captioning to
introduce WaterCaption, the first captioning dataset specifically designed for
waterway environments. WaterCaption focuses on fine-grained, multi-region
long-text descriptions, providing a new research direction for visual
geo-understanding and spatial scene cognition. Exactly, it includes 20.2k
image-text pair data with 1.8 million vocabulary size. Additionally, we propose
Da Yu, an edge-deployable multi-modal large language model for USVs, where we
propose a novel vision-to-language projector called Nano Transformer Adaptor
(NTA). NTA effectively balances computational efficiency with the capacity for
both global and fine-grained local modeling of visual features, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's ability to generate long-form textual
outputs. Da Yu achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency,
surpassing state-of-the-art models on WaterCaption and several other captioning
benchmarks.

comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented requirements of balancing: (i)
dynamical fidelity, (ii) photorealistic rendering, (iii) context-relevant
scenario orchestration, and (iv) real-time performance. To address these
limitations, we present a unified framework for creating and curating
high-fidelity digital twins to accelerate advancements in autonomous driving

techniques for developing and simulating digital twins of autonomous vehicles
and their operating environments. It is capable of reconstructing real-world
scenes and assets (real2sim) with geometric and photorealistic accuracy and
infusing them with various physical properties to enable real-time dynamical
simulation of the ensuing driving scenarios. Additionally, it also incorporates
a large language model (LLM) interface to flexibly edit the driving scenarios
online via natural language prompts. We analyze the presented framework in
terms of its fidelity, performance, and serviceability. Results indicate that
our framework can reconstruct 3D scenes and assets with up to 97% structural
similarity, while maintaining frame rates above 60 Hz. We also demonstrate that
it can handle natural language prompts to generate diverse driving scenarios
with up to 95% repeatability and 85% generalizability.

                                        <span>  Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled significant advances in humanoid
robot locomotion, yet most learning frameworks do not account for mechanical
intelligence embedded in parallel actuation mechanisms due to limitations in
simulator support for closed kinematic chains. This omission can lead to
inaccurate motion modeling and suboptimal policies, particularly for robots
with high actuation complexity. This paper presents an end-to-end curriculum RL
framework for BRUCE, a kid-sized humanoid robot featuring three distinct
parallel mechanisms in its legs: a differential pulley, a 5-bar linkage, and a
4-bar linkage. Unlike prior approaches that rely on simplified serial
approximations, we simulate all closed-chain constraints natively using
GPU-accelerated MJX (MuJoCo), preserving the hardware's physical properties
during training. We benchmark our RL approach against a Model Predictive
Controller (MPC), demonstrating better surface generalization and performance
in real-world zero-shot deployment. This work highlights the computational
approaches and performance benefits of fully simulating parallel mechanisms in
end-to-end learning pipelines for legged humanoids.

                                        <span>  Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for complex
decision-making in machine learning and AI. However, traditional methods often
assume perfect action execution, overlooking the uncertainties and deviations
between an agent's selected actions and the actual system response. In
real-world applications, such as robotics, mechatronics, and communication
networks, execution mismatches arising from system dynamics, hardware
constraints, and latency can significantly degrade performance. This work
advances AI by developing a novel control-optimized DRL framework that
explicitly models and compensates for action execution mismatches, a challenge
largely overlooked in existing methods. Our approach establishes a structured
two-stage process: determining the desired action and selecting the appropriate
control signal to ensure proper execution. It trains the agent while accounting
for action mismatches and controller corrections. By incorporating these
factors into the training process, the AI agent optimizes the desired action
with respect to both the actual control signal and the intended outcome,
explicitly considering execution errors. This approach enhances robustness,
ensuring that decision-making remains effective under real-world uncertainties.
Our approach offers a substantial advancement for engineering practice by
bridging the gap between idealized learning and real-world implementation. It
equips intelligent agents operating in engineering environments with the
ability to anticipate and adjust for actuation errors and system disturbances
during training. We evaluate the framework in five widely used open-source
mechanical simulation environments we restructured and developed to reflect
real-world operating conditions, showcasing its robustness against
uncertainties and offering a highly practical and efficient solution for
control-oriented applications.

algorithms have proven to be crucial for their iterative improvement over the
years. Nevertheless, the ultimate measure of effectiveness is their successful
transition from simulation to reality (sim2real). However, existing sim2real
transfer methods struggle to comprehensively address the autonomy-oriented
requirements of balancing: (i) conditioned domain adaptation, (ii) robust
performance with limited examples, (iii) modularity in handling multiple domain
representations, and (iv) real-time performance. To alleviate these pain
points, we present a unified framework for learning cross-domain adaptive
representations for sim2real transferable autonomous driving algorithms using
conditional latent diffusion models. Our framework offers options to leverage:
(i) alternate foundation models, (ii) a few-shot fine-tuning pipeline, and
(iii) textual as well as image prompts for mapping across given source and
target domains. It is also capable of generating diverse high-quality samples
when diffusing across parameter spaces such as times of day, weather
conditions, seasons, and operational design domains. We systematically analyze
the presented framework and report our findings in the form of critical
quantitative metrics and ablation studies, as well as insightful qualitative
examples and remarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the serviceability of the
proposed approach in bridging the sim2real gap for end-to-end autonomous
driving using a behavioral cloning case study. Our experiments indicate that
the proposed framework is capable of bridging the perceptual sim2real gap by
over 40%. We hope that our approach underscores the potential of generative
diffusion models in sim2real transfer, offering a pathway toward more robust
and adaptive autonomous driving.

might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke
removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular
depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and
vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation
for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the

                                        <span>  High-accuracy and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous
driving systems. While previous studies on 3D object detection often evaluate
performance based on mean average precision (mAP) and latency, they typically
fail to address the trade-off between speed and accuracy, such as 60.0 mAP at
100 ms vs 61.0 mAP at 500 ms. A quantitative assessment of the trade-offs
between different hardware devices and accelerators remains unexplored, despite
being critical for real-time applications. Furthermore, they overlook the
impact on collision avoidance in motion planning, for example, 60.0 mAP leading
to safer motion planning or 61.0 mAP leading to high-risk motion planning. In
this paper, we introduce latency-aware AP (L-AP) and planning-aware AP (P-AP)
as new metrics, which consider the physical world such as the concept of time
and physical constraints, offering a more comprehensive evaluation for
real-time 3D object detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our metrics
for the entire autonomous driving system using nuPlan dataset, and evaluate 3D
object detection models accounting for hardware differences and accelerators.
We also develop a state-of-the-art performance model for real-time 3D object
detection through latency-aware hyperparameter optimization (L-HPO) using our
metrics. Additionally, we quantitatively demonstrate that the assumption "the
more point clouds, the better the recognition performance" is incorrect for
real-time applications and optimize both hardware and model selection using our
metrics.

attain minimal competency. Developing multi-fingered, synchronized control of a
colonoscope requires significant time and exposure to the device. Current
training methods inhibit this development by relying on tool hand-off for
expert demonstrations. There is a need for colonoscopy training tools that
enable in-hand expert guidance in real-time. We present a new concept of a
tandem training system that uses a telemanipulated preceptor colonoscope to
guide novice users as they perform a colonoscopy. This system is capable of
dual-control and can automatically toggle between expert and novice control of
a standard colonoscope's angulation control wheels. Preliminary results from a

as a skill acquisition tool. We believe that this device has the potential to
accelerate skill acquisition for colonoscopy and, in the future, enable
individualized instruction and responsive teaching through bidirectional

Researchers in autonomous driving are actively adapting these methods to the
vehicle domain. Such models promise autonomous vehicles that can interpret
high-level instructions, reason about complex traffic scenes, and make their
own decisions. However, the literature remains fragmented and is rapidly
expanding. This survey offers the first comprehensive overview of VLA for
Autonomous Driving (VLA4AD). We (i) formalize the architectural building blocks
shared across recent work, (ii) trace the evolution from early explainer to
reasoning-centric VLA models, and (iii) compare over 20 representative models
according to VLA's progress in the autonomous driving domain. We also
consolidate existing datasets and benchmarks, highlighting protocols that
jointly measure driving safety, accuracy, and explanation quality. Finally, we

                                        <span>  Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is essential to ensure the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs) before deployment. However, existing
techniques primarily focus on evaluating ADS functionalities in single-AV
settings. As ADSs are increasingly deployed in multi-AV traffic, it becomes
crucial to assess their cooperative performance, particularly regarding
deadlocks, a fundamental coordination failure in which multiple AVs enter a
circular waiting state indefinitely, resulting in motion planning failures.
Despite its importance, the cooperative capability of ADSs to prevent deadlocks
remains insufficiently underexplored. To address this gap, we propose the first
dedicated Spatio-Temporal Conflict-Guided Deadlock Avoidance Testing technique,
STCLocker, for generating DeadLock Scenarios (DLSs), where a group of AVs
controlled by the ADS under test are in a circular wait state. STCLocker
consists of three key components: Deadlock Oracle, Conflict Feedback, and
Conflict-aware Scenario Generation. Deadlock Oracle provides a reliable
black-box mechanism for detecting deadlock cycles among multiple AVs within a
given scenario. Conflict Feedback and Conflict-aware Scenario Generation
collaborate to actively guide AVs into simultaneous competition over spatial
conflict resources (i.e., shared passing regions) and temporal competitive
behaviors (i.e., reaching the conflict region at the same time), thereby
increasing the effectiveness of generating conflict-prone deadlocks. We
evaluate STCLocker on two types of ADSs: Roach, an end-to-end ADS, and OpenCDA,
a module-based ADS supporting cooperative communication. Experimental results
show that, on average, STCLocker generates more DLS than the best-performing
baseline.

                                        <span>  While personalization has been explored in traditional autonomous driving
systems, it remains largely overlooked in end-to-end autonomous driving
(E2EAD), despite its growing prominence. This gap is critical, as user-aligned
behavior is essential for trust, comfort, and widespread adoption of autonomous
vehicles. A core challenge is the lack of large-scale real-world datasets
annotated with diverse and fine-grained driving preferences, hindering the
development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we
present the first large-scale real-world dataset enriched with annotations
capturing diverse driving preferences, establishing a foundation for
personalization in E2EAD. We extract static environmental features from
real-world road topology and infer dynamic contextual cues using a fine-tuned
visual language model (VLM), enabling consistent and fine-grained scenario
construction. Based on these scenarios, we derive objective preference
annotations through behavioral distribution analysis and rule-based heuristics.
To address the inherent subjectivity of driving style, we further employ the
VLM to generate subjective annotations by jointly modeling scene semantics and
driver behavior. Final high-quality labels are obtained through a
human-in-the-loop verification process that fuses both perspectives. Building
on this dataset, we propose the first benchmark for evaluating personalized
E2EAD models. We assess several state-of-the-art models with and without
preference conditioning, demonstrating that incorporating personalized
preferences results in behavior more aligned with human driving. Our work lays
the foundation for personalized E2EAD by providing a standardized platform to
systematically integrate human preferences into data-driven E2EAD systems,
catalyzing future research in human-centric autonomy.

autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have
gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low
computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and
quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from
information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution
difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their
performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil
the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the
height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature
encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete
distribution of points at different heights within one pillar with the
information entropy guidance. This simple yet effective design greatly
preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly
reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also
constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making
it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the
PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing
pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive
experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency
and performance.

block with unknown physical properties to a desired goal pose. We approach this
problem by learning the constituent models of a Partially-Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP), where the robot can observe the outcome of a push,
but the physical properties of the block that govern the dynamics remain
unknown. A common solution approach is to train an observation model in a
supervised fashion, and do inference with a general inference technique such as
particle filters. However, supervised training requires knowledge of the
relevant physical properties that determine the problem dynamics, which we do
not assume to be known. Planning also requires simulating many belief updates,
which becomes expensive when using particle filters to represent the belief. We
propose to learn an Attentive Neural Process that computes the belief over a
learned latent representation of the relevant physical properties given a
history of actions. To address the pushing planning problem, we integrate a
trained Neural Process with a double-progressive widening sampling strategy.
Simulation results indicate that Neural Process Tree with Double Progressive
Widening (NPT-DPW) generates better-performing plans faster than traditional
particle-filter methods that use a supervised-trained observation model, even
in complex pushing scenarios.

the forward kinematics of the robot arm. By integrating it with a generator of
joint angles, another neural network was developed and trained on an artificial

the computation of angular velocities, the robot was characterized by its
ability to perform the movement, and the quality of its action was evaluated in

successfully generates precise trajectories that could be customized in their

                                        <span>  Autonomous exploration for mapping unknown large scale environments is a
fundamental challenge in robotics, with efficiency in time, stability against
map corruption and computational resources being crucial. This paper presents a
novel approach to indoor exploration that addresses these key issues in
existing methods. We introduce a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM)-aware region-based exploration strategy that partitions the environment
into discrete regions, allowing the robot to incrementally explore and
stabilize each region before moving to the next one. This approach
significantly reduces redundant exploration and improves overall efficiency. As
the device finishes exploring a region and stabilizes it, we also perform SLAM
keyframe marginalization, a technique which reduces problem complexity by
eliminating variables, while preserving their essential information. To
improves robustness and further enhance efficiency, we develop a checkpoint
system that enables the robot to resume exploration from the last stable region
in case of failures, eliminating the need for complete re-exploration. Our
method, tested in real homes, office and simulations, outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches. The improvements demonstrate substantial
enhancements in various real world environments, with significant reductions in
keyframe usage (85%), submap usage (50% office, 32% home), pose graph
optimization time (78-80%), and exploration duration (10-15%). This
region-based strategy with keyframe marginalization offers an efficient
solution for autonomous robotic mapping.

                                        <span>  To navigate crowds without collisions, robots must interact with humans by
forecasting their future motion and reacting accordingly. While learning-based
prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory
predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller
presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive
coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both
predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these
challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for
single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to
generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then
incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem
that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety
filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining
planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the
robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop
trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used
ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot
navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments
demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.

                                        <span>  Emotion regulation is a crucial skill for managing emotions in everyday life,
yet finding a constructive and accessible method to support these processes
remains challenging due to their cognitive demands. In this study, we explore
how regular interactions with a social robot, conducted in a structured yet
familiar environment within university halls and departments, can provide
effective support for emotion regulation through cognitive reappraisal.
Twenty-one students participated in a five-session study at a university hall
or department, where the robot, powered by a large language model (GPT-3.5),
facilitated structured conversations, encouraging the students to reinterpret
emotionally charged situations they shared with the robot. Quantitative and
qualitative results indicate significant improvements in emotion
self-regulation, with participants reporting better understanding and control
of their emotions. The intervention led to significant changes in constructive
emotion regulation tendencies and positive effects on mood and sentiment after
each session. The findings also demonstrate that repeated interactions with the
robot encouraged greater emotional expressiveness, including longer speech
disclosures, increased use of affective language, and heightened facial
arousal. Notably, expressiveness followed structured patterns aligned with the
reappraisal process, with expression peaking during key reappraisal moments,
particularly when participants were prompted to reinterpret negative
experiences. The qualitative feedback further highlighted how the robot
fostered introspection and provided a supportive space for discussing emotions,
enabling participants to confront long-avoided emotional challenges. These
findings demonstrate the potential of robots to effectively assist in emotion
regulation in familiar environments, offering both emotional support and
cognitive guidance.
